# Reading and finding

The command line · Using a shell

<!-- Speaker note: Students print files with cat, find lines with grep (including -i, -c and paths to other folders), reveal hidden names with ls -a, and follow a clue trail to a hidden folder (AC9TDI10K01 node 1). About 40 minutes (Predict and Try 6 min · Worked example 10 min · Vary 12 min · Practise and Make 12 min). -->

## Today

**We are learning to** cat prints a whole file and grep prints only the lines that contain a word. Names that start with a dot are hidden: ls skips them, ls -a shows them. With these you can find anything on a computer you can't see.

- I can print a file with cat.
- I can find the lines I want with grep.
- I can find hidden files with ls -a.

<!-- Speaker note: Before class: Try the boards yourself, including the treasure hunt (fs: hunt): start.txt → library/shelf2/book.txt → gym/.locker/clue.txt. The hunt finishes in Pipes. The one idea: you can read and search files you can't see, and "hidden" only means ls skips the name. Teacher: Worked example: ask why catfish was printed. Teacher: Vary: ask why the third task didn't need cd. -->

## Why it matters

> ls shows four things in Sam's home folder. There are five. Where's the other one?

<!-- Speaker note: In *Where files live* you moved around and looked. Now read what's inside files, and find the ones that don't want to be seen. -->

## Predict

**In /home/sam, ls shows notes.txt, pets.txt, photos/ and projects/. Is that everything in the folder?**

- Yes, unless the computer is broken
- Yes: ls always shows everything
- Maybe not: names starting with a dot are hidden from ls
- No: ls only shows files, not folders

<!-- Speaker note: What happens: Not everything: there's a hidden file, .plans.txt. ls skips names that start with a dot; ls -a shows them. Take two or three predictions before anyone runs it. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: students who said "everything" will meet .plans.txt in the Try. -->

## grep cat pets.txt, line by line

Now count the lines.

$$\text{cat} \Rightarrow \text{printed}$$

1) $\text{dog} \Rightarrow \text{skipped}$ — No c-a-t.
2) $\text{catfish} \Rightarrow \text{printed}$ — c-a-t is inside it: grep matches letters anywhere.
3) $\text{parrot, hamster} \Rightarrow \text{skipped}$ — No c-a-t.
4) $\text{cat} \Rightarrow \text{printed}$ — Three lines in all.

<!-- Speaker note: Model this live on the board before revealing anything: write each line and say why, pausing to ask the class what comes next. Then click to reveal the lines and compare. Script. Start: write cat printed and say "The line contains c-a-t." Line 1: write dog skipped and say "No c-a-t." Line 2: write catfish printed and say "c-a-t is inside it: grep matches letters anywhere." Line 3: write parrot, hamster skipped and say "No c-a-t." Line 4: write cat printed and say "Three lines in all." -->

## grep cat pets.txt, line by line

**pets.txt has six lines: cat, dog, catfish, parrot, cat, hamster. How many lines does grep cat pets.txt print?**

* Answer: 3

<!-- Speaker note: cat, catfish and cat: grep matches the letters anywhere in the line. -->

## Find the mistake

**Sam looks for a clue in the gym folder. Click the line where it first goes wrong.**

```
 1  Sam types ls in the gym folder.
 2  ls shows only notice.txt.
 3  So notice.txt is the only thing in the gym folder.
 4  So there is nowhere else to look for the clue.
```

* Answer: line 3

<!-- Speaker note: Line 3: ls skips hidden names. ls -a might show a hidden folder or file. -->

## Capital letters

**grep Friday notes.txt prints "Robot club on Friday". What does grep friday notes.txt print?**

- An error
- Every line
- Nothing: grep cares about capital letters (grep -i ignores them)
- The same line

* Answer: Nothing: grep cares about capital letters (grep -i ignores them)

<!-- Speaker note: grep -i friday notes.txt ignores capitals and finds it. -->

## Vary: find it fast

<!-- Speaker note: What this step is for: Each task changes one thing: one matching line, counting with grep -c, then reading a file in another folder without moving. For students who need more support: Add to the card: cat file (print it), grep word file (lines with word), ls -a (hidden too). For early finishers: grep -n shows line numbers and grep -v shows the lines that don't match. When would each be useful? The hard part, on purpose: grep matching inside words (catfish) surprises students; let the count come out wrong once, then look at the lines. When students get stuck: A student says there's nothing more in the gym (Sam's mistake). Ask: What did ls -a show in your home folder that ls didn't? Fix: Try ls -a in the gym too. / grep finds nothing. Ask: Do the capitals match? Fix: grep is case sensitive; grep -i ignores capitals. -->

- ls -a log.txt
- grep ERROR log.txt

Hints, in order: Start with cat start.txt. / Each clue names a folder. Look inside with ls; read with cat. / The gym clue is hidden: ls -a. -->

**How would you print only the lines of notes.txt with the word maths in them, and how would you check for hidden files?**

* grep maths notes.txt; ls -a.
