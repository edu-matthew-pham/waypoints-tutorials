# Tables

Structure and style a page · Parts of a page

<!-- Speaker note: Students build tables one row at a time with table, tr, th and td, and learn that every row needs the same number of cells. About 45 minutes (Predict and Run 10 min · Investigate 12 min · Modify 8 min · Mix it up 4 min · Make 10 min). The Run, Modify and Make slides have the live playground in them; the tutorial link under it is the backup. -->

## Today

- I can build a table from rows (&lt;tr&gt;) of cells (&lt;th&gt; and &lt;td&gt;).
- I can explain why a table is written a row at a time and every row needs the same number of cells.
- I can add a row and a column to a table.

<!-- Speaker note: Before class: Do the Make task yourself (about 5 minutes). A table is built **row by row**: `<tr>` is a table row, `<th>` a heading cell and `<td>` an ordinary cell ("table data"). Columns are not written anywhere: they appear because every row has its cells in the same order. Students who think in columns, or in spreadsheets, often write all of one column first. Tables are for data; the look (lines, colours) comes from rules, and page layout is a later course. Teacher: Mix it up: the row takes the class and the name's cell holds the link. Ask where each piece goes before they answer. -->

## Why it matters

> A bus timetable is a grid of rows and columns, and so is the code behind it.

<!-- Speaker note: Some information is a grid: rows going across, columns going down. HTML has no tag for a column. You write the table **one row at a time** and the columns appear. -->

## Predict

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>House</th>
    <th>Points</th>
    <th>Wins</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Owls</td>
    <td>12</td>
    <td>4</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

**How will the six words be arranged on the page?**

- 3 rows of 2 words, because each &lt;tr&gt; is a column
- 6 lines, one word on each
- 1 row of 6 words
- 2 rows of 3 words, lined up in columns

<!-- Speaker note: What happens: 2 rows of 3 words. Each &lt;tr&gt; is one row going across, and its three cells line up under the cells of the other row to make 3 columns. Take two or three predictions before anyone runs it. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: the tempting wrong answer is 3 rows of 2 words, reading each `<tr>` as a column. Run it with **Boxes** on to see each row as a box going across. -->

## Rows or columns? <span style="font-size:.6em;color:#64748b">(3 min)</span>

Look at the code. Is the first `<tr>` a row going across or a column going down?
Point with your arm, then tell your partner why.

<!-- Speaker note: Most students point across when asked, then say 3 rows of 2 when asked what the page shows. Let them see the clash before running. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Compare the page with your prediction. **Boxes** is on, so each row and each cell shows as a box.

You write the table a row at a time | | `<th>House</th>` | Makes a heading cell | `th` is "table heading". The browser makes it bold and centred | | `<td>Owls</td>` | Makes an ordinary cell | `td` is "table data". The tag says what it is; the look is the browser's | | three cells in each row | Make three columns | There is no column tag. A column is the cells in the same place in each row, so every row needs the same number of cells | | no lines around the cells | The table has no grid | The browser draws none. Colours and text styles come from rules, as for any other tag | Students should be able to say: I can say which tag makes a row and which makes a cell. -->

## What happened?

* 2 rows of 3 words. Each &lt;tr&gt; is one row going across, and its three cells line up under the cells of the other row to make 3 columns.

<!-- Speaker note: Reveal after running. Ask who predicted it, and what made them think so. -->

## Build a row

**Put the lines in order to make one row for the Kestrels: 7 points and 2 wins. One line is not needed.**

```html
  <td>7</td>
  <td>2</td>
  <td>Kestrels</td>
</table>
</tr>
<tr>
```

<!-- Speaker note: <tr> opens the row, the three cells go inside it in the same order as the headings, and </tr> closes it. </table> would end the whole table. Correct order: <tr> <td>Kestrels</td> <td>7</td> <td>2</td> </tr> -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: the row-building task and Sam's table are the same idea from two sides: the cells of one house belong in one `<tr>`. The short row is the quiet failure: the browser shows it without complaint, so count cells per row. -->

## Sam's table

Sam wrote the table a column at a time.

```html
<table>
  <tr><td>Owls</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Hawks</td></tr>
  <tr><td>12</td></tr>
  <tr><td>9</td></tr>
</table>
```

**Sam wrote the names first, then the points, with one &lt;tr&gt; for each. Sam wanted two columns, House and Points. How many columns does the page have?**

- 1, because every &lt;tr&gt; holds one cell
- 2, because there are names and points
- It shows an error
- 4, because there are four &lt;tr&gt; tags

* Answer: 1, because every &lt;tr&gt; holds one cell

<!-- Speaker note: Every <tr> is a row with one cell, so the page has four rows and one column. To get House and Points side by side, each house needs its own <tr> with both cells in it. -->

## The short row

**The Hawks have no points, and their row is shorter than the others. Click the line that causes it.**

```
 1  <table>
 2    <tr><th>House</th><th>Points</th></tr>
 3    <tr><td>Owls</td><td>12</td></tr>
 4    <tr><td>Hawks</td></tr>
 5    <tr><td>Kestrels</td><td>7</td></tr>
 6  </table>
```

* Answer: line 4

<!-- Speaker note: Line 4 has only one cell. Every row needs a cell for each column, so the Hawks row needs <td>9</td> after the name. The browser shows the short row without any error. -->

## Modify



- **Add a row:** Add the Kestrels, with 7 points.
- **Add a column:** Add a `Wins` column: the Owls have 4, the Hawks 3 and the Kestrels 2.

<!-- Speaker note: What this step is for: Adding a row is one new <tr>; adding a column touches every row. Hints, in order: Copy a whole row, from `<tr>` to `</tr>`, then change the words. / A new column needs a heading cell in the first row. / Then every other row needs one more `<td>`. For students who need more support: Give students the Modify starter and ask them only to copy the Hawks row and change it to the Kestrels. For early finishers: Add a caption with <caption>House points</caption> just after <table>, and a totals row at the bottom. Style the heading cells with a th rule. The hard part, on purpose: Building a table row by row with the same number of cells in each. Have them count the cells per row before they look at the page. When students get stuck: One row is shorter than the others, or a value sits in the wrong column. Ask: Does every row have the same number of cells, in the same order? Fix: Add the missing <td> so each row has a cell for every column. / Text appears above the table instead of inside it. Ask: Is that text inside a <td> or <th>? Fix: All text in a table goes inside cells; a title goes above the <table> in an <h2>. / The new column only has a heading. Ask: Which rows have a cell for the new column? Fix: Add one <td> to every data row, in the same position. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: adding a column is the hard part. It needs a `<th>` in the heading row and a `<td>` in every other row. -->

## Change a bus timetable

A bus timetable is a table. The 7 now stops at the Park at 8:16, between the Market and the Library, so add that row in the right place. Then add a Platform column, with a heading and a platform number for every stop.

<!-- Speaker note: Hints, in order: A new row is a whole `<tr>` ... `</tr>`. Put it between the Market row and the Library row. A new column needs one more cell in every row, the heading row too. -->

Class idea: collect class data (favourite sport, pets) and publish it as a table. -->
