# A map of rooms

Deeper Python in the console · Lists and dictionaries

<!-- Speaker note: Students store a map in dictionaries (rooms by name, and each room's exits), look values up by key, check keys with in, use a dictionary inside a dictionary, and count words with a dictionary. About 50 minutes (Predict and Run 10 min · Investigate 15 min · Modify 10 min · Make 15 min). The Run, Modify and Make slides have the live playground in them; the tutorial link under it is the backup. -->

## Today

**We are learning to** store rooms and exits in dictionaries, look things up by name, put a dictionary inside a dictionary, and count words.

- I can make a dictionary and look up a value by its key.
- I can check whether a key is in a dictionary before looking it up.
- I can use a dictionary to count things.

<!-- Speaker note: Before class: Read the unit primer first. A dictionary pairs keys with values: `{"north": "kitchen"}`; `exits["north"]` looks up the value. Keys must match exactly (the bug task: `"Hall"` is not `"hall"`, so KeyError). `"west" in exits` checks for a key. `exits[here]` is itself a dictionary, so `exits[here]["north"]` looks up twice. `", ".join(exits[here])` joins the keys. Counting with a dictionary (the Make task) is a classic pattern: a new key starts at 1, an existing one goes up by 1. Teacher: Bug task: ask what Hall and hall have in common, and what Python thinks. -->

---

## Why it matters

> A phone's contacts, a dictionary app and a game's map all do the same thing: look something up by its name.

<!-- Speaker note: A list finds things by place: `words[0]`. A **dictionary** finds things by name: `exits["north"]` is wherever north leads. The adventure keeps its rooms in one dictionary and its exits in another. -->

## Predict

```python
exits = {"north": "kitchen", "east": "garden"}
print(exits["north"])
print("west" in exits)
```

**What is the first line it prints?**

- kitchen
- {'north': 'kitchen'}
- garden
- north

<!-- Speaker note: What happens: kitchen: the value stored under the key "north". The second line is False, because "west" is not a key. Take two or three predictions before anyone runs it. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: draw the dictionary as a two-column table, key and value. -->

Students should be able to say: I can explain how the program finds where go north leads. -->

## Investigate

```python
rooms = {
    "hall": "A long hall with a creaky floor.",
    "kitchen": "A kitchen that smells of toast.",
    "garden": "A garden full of tall grass.",
}
exits = {

    "kitchen": {"south": "hall"},
    "garden": {"west": "hall"},
}
here = "hall"
while True:

    print("Exits: " + ", ".join(exits[here]))
    command = input("> ").strip().lower()
    words = command.split()
    if command == "quit":

    elif len(words) == 2 and words[0] == "go":
        if words[1] in exits[here]:

## A dictionary in a dictionary

**What is exits["hall"]["east"]?**

- "kitchen"
- "garden"
- "hall"
- {"north": "kitchen", "east": "garden"}

* Answer: "garden"

<!-- Speaker note: exits["hall"] is the hall's own exits dictionary; ["east"] looks up east in it: the garden. -->

## A wall

**You are in the kitchen and type go west. What happens?**

- It stops with an error
- It prints You can't go that way.
- You go to the garden
- You go back to the hall

* Answer: It prints You can't go that way.

<!-- Speaker note: "west" in exits["kitchen"] is False (the kitchen only has south), so the else replies instead of looking it up. -->

## Spot the bug

**This stops with KeyError: Hall. Click the line that causes it.**

```
 1  rooms = {"hall": "A long hall.", "kitchen": "A warm kitchen."}
 2  here = "Hall"
 3  print(rooms[here])
```

* Answer: line 2

<!-- Speaker note: Keys must match exactly: the room is "hall", but here is "Hall" with a capital. Dictionaries do not guess. -->

## Modify



- **An attic:** Add an **attic**, reached by `go up` from the hall (and `go down` back).
- **Count the moves:** Count each move, and say how many when the player quits.

<!-- Speaker note: What this step is for: A new room is one entry in rooms and one in exits; the loop that walks around needs no change. Hints, in order: Add "attic": "..." to rooms, and "attic": {"down": "hall"} to exits. / Then add "up": "attic" to the hall's exits. / Start moves = 0 before the loop, add moves += 1 when the player moves, and print it when they quit. For students who need more support: Give students the loop over the words and the if, and ask them to fill in the two lines that count. For early finishers: Put things in rooms (a dictionary from room to a list of things) and let the player take them into last lesson's bag. The hard part, on purpose: A dictionary of dictionaries: two lookups in one line. Have them say each step aloud (which room, then which way) before writing rooms[here][way]. When students get stuck: KeyError: ... Ask: Is the key spelled exactly as it was stored, capitals included? Fix: Tidy text before using it as a key (lower()), or check with in first. / The new room cannot be reached. Ask: Which room's exits lead to it? Fix: Add it to another room's exits as well as to rooms and exits. / The word counter crashes on the first word (KeyError). Ask: What is counts[word] before that word has been seen? Fix: If the word is not in counts yet, set it to 1; otherwise add 1. -->

## Make a word counter

Ask for a **sentence** and print how many times each word appears, such as `the: 3`. Start with an empty dictionary, `counts = {}`. For each word: if it is already a key, add 1; if not, set it to 1. Tidy the sentence first so that `The` and `the` count as the same word.

<!-- Speaker note: What this step is for: A dictionary can count: each new key starts at 1, and a key already there goes up by one. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: act it out with words on cards. A new word gets a tally of 1; a word seen before gets another tally. -->

You now have the parts of a text adventure: a command parser, a bag and a map. Still to come in this course: handling errors with `try`, saving and loading a game in a file, and the adventure itself.

## Exit ticket

**ages = {"Ada": 12}. What do ages["Ada"] and "Bo" in ages give?**

* 12, and False: Bo is not a key.

<!-- Speaker note: Students answer on paper or a mini whiteboard before the reveal. Anyone who cannot answer needs the main idea again next lesson. Where this leads: This completes the lessons that run in the turtle playground. Still to come: errors with try, saving the game to a file, and the text adventure, which joins the parser, the bag and the map. Data detective uses lists of dictionaries for real data. -->
