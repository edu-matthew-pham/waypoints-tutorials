# Challenge: lay out the club page

Layout and components · Final challenge: lay out the club page

<!-- Speaker note: Students lay out the club page from Structure and style a page in three milestones with fading support (header and menu, then a hero and a wrapping row of cards, then the table, a sign-up card and the footer), then make it their own. About 90 minutes (Plan 10 min · Milestone 1 15 min · Milestone 2 25 min · Milestone 3 25 min · Make it yours 15 min). The Run, Modify and Make slides have the live playground in them; the tutorial link under it is the backup. -->

## Today

- I can plan a layout as a list of parts.
- I can put a name and a menu on one line with Flexbox, and style the menu links with nav a.
- I can build a hero and a row of cards that wraps, sharing one class.
- I can lay out a table, a form card and a footer.

<!-- Speaker note: Before class: Read the challenge primer "Running the final challenge", then build milestone 1 yourself and plan milestones 2 and 3 on paper. There is **nothing new** in this lesson. The starter is the finished club page from Structure and style a page, so students who skipped that course can still start here. Every milestone recalls earlier lessons: rules that combine and `nav a`, block and inline, the box, Flexbox rows, `gap`, `justify-content`, wrapping and components. Support fades on purpose: milestone 1 gives the exact code, milestone 2 an outline in comments, milestone 3 only the goals. There is no separate review step, because the whole lesson is review. Finishing this lesson marks **Challenge complete** on the course page. Teacher: Plan the layout: match each part to its rule. Write the parts on the board as a checklist. Teacher: Milestone 1: everyone should finish this in the first lesson. Ask where display: flex goes, and why there are two flex boxes. Teacher: Milestone 2: the outline is in the comments. Students who are stuck can use **Reset to this task's start** to load a working milestone 1. Teacher: Milestone 3: goals only. Ask students to name which earlier rule each goal reuses before typing. -->

## Why it matters

> Take a page that only runs down the screen and give it a layout: a menu on the right, cards in a row, a sign-up card.

<!-- Speaker note: You've built a club page that runs down the screen in order, and now it's time to lay it out. You've met everything you need already, so check the page after every change. -->

## Name the parts

**Match each part of the laid-out page with the rule that makes it.**

| | |
|---|---|
| `The club name on the left, the menu on the right` | A. one class on all three, and one .card rule |
| `The menu links in a row, without underlines` | B. nav ul { display: flex; } and nav a { } |
| `Three cards that share one look` | C. flex-wrap: wrap, with flex: 1 and a min-width on the card |
| `Cards that drop to a new line on a phone` | D. display: block on label |
| `Room inside each card, and a line around it` | E. display: flex and justify-content: space-between on the header |
| `Each form label on its own line` | F. padding and border |

* Answer: The club name on the left, the menu on the right → E. display: flex and justify-content: space-between on the header; The menu links in a row, without underlines → B. nav ul { display: flex; } and nav a { }; Three cards that share one look → A. one class on all three, and one .card rule; Cards that drop to a new line on a phone → C. flex-wrap: wrap, with flex: 1 and a min-width on the card; Room inside each card, and a line around it → F. padding and border; Each form label on its own line → D. display: block on label

<!-- Speaker note: Each part is a lesson you have done. Build them in order: header and menu, then the hero and cards, then the table, form and footer. -->

## Count the cost

**You add a fourth card to the row. How much new CSS do you write?**

- None: copy a card, and the .card rule styles it too
- A new row with display: flex
- A new width for all four cards
- A new .card4 rule

* Answer: None: copy a card, and the .card rule styles it too

<!-- Speaker note: A class is shared by every copy. Adding a card is copying HTML, not writing CSS. -->

With your partner, point to each part of the laid-out page and name the rule behind it.

## Build the layout



- **Milestone 1: header and menu:** The name and the menu sit one above the other. Put them on one line. Replace the `header` rule with this one, and add the two rules below it: The header holds t
- **Milestone 2: a hero and cards:** Follow the comments. Build: - a hero: a `<section class="hero">` with an `<h2>`, a paragraph and a link to `#join`, styled by a `.hero` rule; - a `<section clas
- **Milestone 3: table, form and footer:** Goals only this time: - the results table has padding and a border on its cells; - the sign-up form is a card, with each label on its own line; - the footer has
- **Test the layout:** Raise the cards' `min-width` (try `300px`). The cards should drop onto new lines and none should squash. Then click every menu link and every label.

<!-- Speaker note: What this step is for: Three milestones with fading support: the full code, then an outline, then only the goals. Hints, in order: Replace the `header` rule with the one in the lesson, then add the `nav ul` and `nav a` rules below it. / `display: flex` goes on the box that holds the items: the header holds the name and the menu, and the `ul` holds the links. / `justify-content: space-between` pushes the name left and the menu right. / Follow the outline in the comments: each comment becomes one piece of HTML or one rule. / The cards row is a `<section class="cards">` that holds three `<div class="card">`. Put `display: flex`, `flex-wrap: wrap` and `gap` on `.cards`. / Put `flex: 1` and `min-width: 200px` on `.card`, with `padding` and a `border`. Adding a fourth card needs no new CSS. / The goals list three parts: the table, the sign-up form and the footer. Do one at a time and check the page after each. / The form is a card: reuse the class you already have, `<form class="card">`. No new rule is needed for that. / Labels are inline, so they sit beside their box. `display: block` on `label` gives each its own line. For students who need more support: Let students use Reset to this task's start at each milestone, so everyone reaches milestone 3. Pair students for milestone 3: one does the table, one the form. For early finishers: Add a fourth card, then a second row of cards. Try justify-content: center on the cards and see what changes. Try the optional lessons on Grid and on making the page react. The hard part, on purpose: Planning a whole layout from parts they already know, and putting display flex on the right box. Have them name the box that holds the items first. When students get stuck: Nothing moved in the header. Ask: Which box holds the name and the menu, and does it have display flex? Fix: Put display flex on the header, the box that holds them, not on the h1 or the nav. / The menu links are still stacked in a column. Ask: Which box holds the links? Fix: Put display flex on nav ul, the list that holds the li items. / The cards stay in one row and squash when they have no min-width. Ask: Does the row have flex-wrap wrap, and does the card have a min-width? Fix: Add flex-wrap wrap to .cards, and flex 1 with min-width 200px to .card. / The labels still sit beside their boxes. Ask: Are labels block or inline? Fix: Labels are inline. Add label { display: block; }. -->

## Exit ticket

**Name three parts of your layout and the rule behind each.**

* For example: the name left and the menu right is display flex with justify-content space-between on the header; the cards share one .card rule; the cards wrap because the row has flex-wrap wrap.
