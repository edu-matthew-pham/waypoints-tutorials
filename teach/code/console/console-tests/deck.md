# Test with a table

Console bridge: text in, text out · Menus and testing

<!-- Speaker note: Students write test cases as comparison lines, find a bug with a wrong-choice test, and fix the code. About 35 minutes (Predict and Run 8 min · Investigate 8 min · Modify 8 min · Mix it up 3 min · Make 8 min). The Run, Modify and Make slides have the live playground in them; the tutorial link under it is the backup. -->

---

## Today

- I can write a test case as a line that shows True or False.
- I can include a wrong choice in my tests.
- I can fix code until all my tests show True.

---

## Why it matters

> Apps are tested before anyone uses them. A test case says what to type and what should come back, and the computer checks it every time.

<!-- Speaker note: A menu is awkward to test by typing: you have to type the same choices every time. If the menu's replies come from a **function**, you can test the function with one line per case, and the computer says `True` or `False` for each. -->

## Predict

```python
def reply(choice):
    if choice == "1":
        return "Added $5"
    elif choice == "2":
        return "Pay now"
    else:
        return "Please choose 1 or 2"

print(reply("1") == "Added $5")
print(reply("2") == "Pay now")
print(reply("9") == "Please choose 1 or 2.")
```

**What do the three test lines show?**

- False, True, True
- True, True, True: if the first two work the third will too
- An error, because reply needs the loop
- True, True, False

<!-- Speaker note: What happens: True, True, False. reply("9") returns Please choose 1 or 2 with no full stop, but the test expects one. The first two cases only tried choices that work. The wrong-choice test is the one that found the slip. Take two or three predictions before anyone runs it. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: the common slip is trusting the first two tests. Let students argue before running. Ask the all-True voters what would convince them the function works for every input. -->

## What happened?

* True, True, False. reply("9") returns Please choose 1 or 2 with no full stop, but the test expects one. The first two cases only tried choices that work. The wrong-choice test is the one that found the slip.

## Investigate

print(reply("9") == "Please choose 1 or 2.")
```

<!-- Speaker note: What this step is for: A test case is an input and the reply you expect. Good tests include the wrong inputs. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: the last trace line has a wrong expectation. A False test does not always mean the function is wrong: it can be the test. -->

## Read the tests

<div class="side" style="display:grid;grid-template-columns:1fr 1fr;gap:1em">

```python
def reply(choice):
    if choice == "1":
        return "Added $5"
    elif choice == "2":

    else:

| reply("9") == "Please choose 1 or 2." | ? |
| reply("1") == "Added $4" | ? |

* Answer: True, False, False

</div>

<!-- Speaker note: A test shows True only when the function gives back exactly what the test expects. The last line is a wrong expectation, so it shows False even though the function is fine. -->

## Spot the bug

**This test was meant to check the wrong-choice reply, but the program stops with an error before it runs. Click the wrong line.**

```
 1  def reply(choice):
 2      if choice == "1":
 3          return "Added $5"
 4      elif choice == "2":
 5          return "Pay now"
 6      else:
 7          return "Please choose 1 or 2."
 8  
 9  print(reply("9") = "Please choose 1 or 2.")
```

* Answer: line 9

<!-- Speaker note: A single = stores a value. A test compares with two: reply("9") == "Please choose 1 or 2.". -->

## Modify



- **Add a test:** Add a test line for a wrong choice.
- **Fix the slip:** If it shows `False`, fix the function, and run the tests again.

<!-- Speaker note: What this step is for: Find the bug with a test, then fix the code and run all the tests again. Hints, in order: Copy a test line and change what you type, and what you expect, to a wrong choice such as 9. / The new test shows False. Compare the reply text in the function with the text in the test. For students who need more support: Give the test lines with the expected text missing and ask for it. For early finishers: Add a test for the choice 2 with the number typed as 2 instead of "2". What happens? The hard part, on purpose: Believing the program works because the easy tests pass. Ask which input has not been tried. When students get stuck: Every test shows False. Ask: Are the expected texts exactly the same as the replies, including spaces and full stops? Fix: Copy the reply text from the function into the test. / A SyntaxError on a test line. Ask: Is it = or == in the comparison? Fix: Tests compare with two equals signs. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: students add the missing test, watch it show False, and fix the function. -->

- Pay now only

<!-- Speaker note: Each pass prints what reply gives back. 2 shows Pay now, and then break ends the loop. What this step is for: The menu loop calls the function and prints what it returns. The function can be tested on its own. -->

## Exit ticket

**Why should a test list always include a wrong input?**

* Wrong inputs are where bugs hide. If only the cases that work are tested, a bug in the other cases is never found.

<!-- Speaker note: Students answer on paper or a mini whiteboard before the reveal. Anyone who cannot answer needs the main idea again next lesson. Where this leads: Next: the challenge. Build a console app that uses every move so far, with test cases of your own. -->
