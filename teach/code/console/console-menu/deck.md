# A menu that keeps showing

Console bridge: text in, text out · Menus and testing

<!-- Speaker note: Students build a menu with while True, choose with if and elif, and leave with break. About 35 minutes (Predict and Run 9 min · Investigate 9 min · Modify 5 min · Mix it up 3 min · Make 9 min). The Run, Modify and Make slides have the live playground in them; the tutorial link under it is the backup. -->

## Today

- I can use while True with break to make a menu that keeps showing.
- I can add a choice to a menu with elif.
- I can build my own small menu app.

---

## Why it matters

> An ATM shows you the choices, waits, does what you picked, then shows you the choices again.

<!-- Speaker note: A `while` loop stops when its condition turns false. A menu has no such moment: it should keep showing until the person says **stop**. So it loops for ever and leaves from the inside, with `break`. -->

## Predict

```python
total = 0
while True:
    choice = input("1 add $5, 2 pay: ")
    if choice == "1":
        total += 5
        print("Total: $" + str(total))
    elif choice == "2":
        print("Pay $" + str(total))
        break
    else:
        print("Please choose 1 or 2.")
print("Thank you")
```

**You type 1, 1, 3, then 2. What does the program show?**

- Total: $5, Total: $10, Please choose 1 or 2., Pay $10, Thank you
- Total: $5, Total: $10, Please choose 1 or 2., and then the program stops
- It never stops, even after 2
- Total: $5, Total: $10, Please choose 1 or 2., Pay $10, and then it asks again

<!-- Speaker note: What happens: Total: $5, Total: $10, Please choose 1 or 2., Pay $10, Thank you. break leaves the whole loop at once, not just the if, so the program carries on after the loop and ends. Take two or three predictions before anyone runs it. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: take a vote. The wrong options are three real beliefs: break only leaves the if, a wrong choice ends the program, and nothing ends it. -->

## What happened?

## Investigate

<!-- Speaker note: What this step is for: A menu is a loop that ends only when you choose to end it. Every way out must be a break. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: the bug has no break line at all, so the loop cannot end. Ask what ends a while True. -->

## What does break do?

<div>

```python
total = 0
while True:
    choice = input("1 add $5, 2 pay: ")
    if choice == "1":
        total += 5
        print("Total: $" + str(total))

<div>

**What does break do when it runs inside an if inside a while True?**

- Stops the program
- Leaves only the if
- Skips to the next pass
- Leaves the whole loop at once

* Answer: Leaves the whole loop at once

</div>
</div>

<!-- Speaker note: break ends the loop it is in. The program continues with the first line after the loop. -->

## Modify

Add a drink for $2 as choice 3. Paying becomes choice 4. Update the menu text too.

<!-- Speaker note: What this step is for: Adding a choice is one more elif; the loop and the way out stay as they are. Hints, in order: Add an elif for a new choice before the pay choice, and change the menu text. / Pay becomes choice 4, so change the pay elif too. For students who need more support: Give the menu with the choices as comments and ask the student to fill in each branch. For early finishers: Add a choice that clears the total and starts the order again. The hard part, on purpose: Forgetting a way out. Ask what makes a while True stop. When students get stuck: The program never ends. Ask: Which line makes the loop stop? Fix: One branch needs a break line, indented inside the loop. / A wrong choice makes the program do something odd. Ask: What does the program do when none of the choices match? Fix: Add an else with a message, such as Please choose 1, 2 or 3. -->

Make your own menu app: a café, a game shop, a quiz scoreboard or a unit converter. It needs `while True`, at least three choices, a reply for a wrong choice, and a way to quit.

<!-- Speaker note: Hints, in order: A menu starts with while True: and an input line inside it. / Use if / elif for each choice and else for anything else. One choice runs break. -->
