# If and else

Python Foundations with Turtle · Choices and lists

<!-- Speaker note: Students make a program choose between two paths with if and else, reading a condition that is true or false. About 35 minutes (Predict and Run 10 min · Investigate 10 min · Modify 5 min · Mix it up 3 min · Make 7 min). The Run, Modify and Make slides have the live playground in them; the tutorial link under it is the backup. -->

---

## Today

**We are learning to** make a program choose which lines to run, using if and else.

- I can write an if / else that chooses between two actions.
- I can work out whether a condition is true for a given value.
- I can say that only one of the two paths runs on each pass.

<!-- Speaker note: Before class: Run the red and blue hexagon, then change `i < 3` to `i < 4`. Notice that only the number in the condition changed. `<` means "less than". Teacher: Mix it up: students work the number out on paper. It joins a growing value to a decision, so the condition reads size, not i. -->

---

## Why it matters

> Traffic lights, game scores, login screens and thermostats all do the same thing: check a condition and pick what happens next.

<!-- Speaker note: So far every line of your program has run, every time. Now the program will **choose**: run some lines if something is true, and other lines if it is not. -->

---

## By the end of this lesson

Here is the finished program running. By the end of the lesson you will write one like it.

<!-- Speaker note: Run the finished example on the projector before anything else. -->

## The same program as a flowchart

```mermaid

  accTitle: The same program as a flowchart
  accDescr: A flowchart of the loop. i counts 0 to 5. Each time, the check asks: is i less than 3? If True, the pen turns red. If False, the pen turns blue. Either way the turtle goes forward 60 and turns 60, then the next i comes back to the check.
  A[i counts 0 to 5] --> B{"Is i < 3?"}
  B -- True --> C[Pen red]
  B -- False --> D[Pen blue]
  C --> E[Forward 60, turn 60]
  D --> E
  E -- next i --> B
  class B new

## Predict

```python
from turtle import *

pensize(6)
for i in range(6):
    if i < 3:
        pencolor("red")
    else:
        pencolor("blue")
    forward(60)
    right(60)
```

**What will the turtle draw?**

- A hexagon with the sides taking turns, red then blue
- A hexagon: three red sides, then three blue
- A hexagon with every side red, then every side blue (twelve lines)
- A blue hexagon, because else runs last and covers the red

<!-- Speaker note: What happens: Three red sides, then three blue. On each pass the program asks one question, i &lt; 3, and runs only one of the two paths. i is 0, 1, 2 for the first three passes (red) and 3, 4, 5 for the last three (blue). Take two or three predictions before anyone runs it. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: show the loop and take a vote before anyone runs it. The wrong options are three slips: both paths run on every pass, the sides take turns, and the else covers everything. -->

## What happened?

* Three red sides, then three blue. On each pass the program asks one question, i &lt; 3, and runs only one of the two paths. i is 0, 1, 2 for the first three passes (red) and 3, 4, 5 for the last three (blue).

<!-- Speaker note: Reveal after running. Ask who predicted it, and what made them think so. -->

## Investigate

```python
from turtle import *

pensize(6)
for i in range(6):
    if i < 3:
        pencolor("red")
    else:
        pencolor("blue")
    forward(60)
    right(60)
```

<!-- Speaker note: What this step is for: A decision is a condition plus two paths. You can follow it by working out the condition for each value, and find a bug by checking the form of the condition. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: students fill in the trace table before running anything. The bug task is the classic slip: = stores, == asks. The last question shows that a condition works out to True or False, like a sum works out to a number. -->

## Spot the bug

**This should colour only the fourth side red, but the program will not even start. Click the wrong line.**

* Answer: line 5

## Modify

Change the condition so **four** sides are red and two are blue. Run it to check.

<!-- Speaker note: What this step is for: Changing a condition changes which passes take which path, and nothing else in the program. Hints, in order: Which number sets where the red stops and the blue starts? / i is 0, 1, 2, 3 for four passes. Which test is true for exactly those? For students who need more support: Give the trace table with the first two rows done and ask the student to say each condition aloud before filling in the colour. For early finishers: Colour the first half of the lines red and the second half blue without typing the number 6 anywhere in the condition. The hard part, on purpose: Writing a condition: the comparison sign, the colon, and the idea that only one path runs. Ask them to work out the condition for i = 0, 1, 2 before running. When students get stuck: A SyntaxError on the if line. Ask: Does the condition ask a question (==, <) or store a value (=)? Is there a colon at the end? Fix: Use == or < to compare, and end the line with a colon: if i < 3: / Every side is the same colour. Ask: Is the if / else inside the loop, so it is asked again every pass? Fix: Indent the if / else under the for line so it runs once per pass. / The spiral is all red or all blue. Ask: What is size on the first pass and on the last? Is the cut-off between them? Fix: The cut-off must be a number size passes through, for example 60. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: one number changes. Ask: which passes are true now? -->

## Make

The spiral grows by 10 every pass. Make it **red while the lines are short and blue once they are long**. Then try a different cut-off, or a third colour of your own once you have seen `elif` next lesson.

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: the colour depends on the line length. Check that the if / else is inside the loop, so it is asked again on every pass. -->

## Exit ticket

**A loop colours pass i red if i &lt; 2, else blue. For range(5), how many passes are blue?**

* Three. The red passes are i = 0 and 1, so 2, 3 and 4 are blue.

<!-- Speaker note: Students answer on paper or a mini whiteboard before the reveal. Anyone who cannot answer needs the main idea again next lesson.
