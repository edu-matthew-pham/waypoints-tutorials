# For each item

Python Foundations with Turtle · Choices and lists

<!-- Speaker note: Students visit every item of a list with a for-each loop, and see that the loop name holds the item itself. About 30 minutes (Predict and Run 8 min · Investigate 8 min · Modify 5 min · Mix it up 3 min · Make 6 min). The Run, Modify and Make slides have the live playground in them; the tutorial link under it is the backup. -->

---

## Today

- I can use a for loop to visit each item in a list.
- I can say what the loop name holds on each pass.
- I can draw one thing for each item in a list.

<!-- Speaker note: Before class: Run the coloured squares and the bar chart. The idea to have ready: in `for c in colours`, `c` is the colour itself, not its place. Teacher: Mix it up: students work the count out on paper. Each score is tested as it is visited. -->

---

## Why it matters

> A playlist doesn't count its songs. It just plays the next one until there are none left.

<!-- Speaker note: Last lesson you picked items by their place. Often you don't care about the place: you want to do something with **each** item. -->

---

## By the end of this lesson

Here is the finished program running. By the end of the lesson you will write one like it.

<!-- Speaker note: Run the finished example on the projector before anything else. -->

## Predict

```python
from turtle import *

colours = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue"]
size = 40

penup()
goto(-130, 0)
pendown()

for c in colours:
    fillcolor(c)
    begin_fill()
    for side in range(4):
        forward(size)
        right(90)
    end_fill()
    penup()
    forward(size + 10)
    pendown()
```

**On the first time round the loop, what does c hold?**

- "red", the first colour itself
- the whole list
- nothing yet
- 0, the place of the first colour

<!-- Speaker note: What happens: "red", the first colour itself. In for c in colours, c is each item in turn: first "red", then "orange", and so on. It is not a place number. Take two or three predictions before anyone runs it. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: ask what c holds the first time round. The wrong options are the place number, the whole list, and nothing. -->

## What happened?

## Investigate

```python
from turtle import *

colours = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue"]
size = 40

penup()
goto(-130, 0)
pendown()

for c in colours:
    fillcolor(c)
    begin_fill()
    for side in range(4):
        forward(size)
        right(90)
    end_fill()
    penup()
    forward(size + 10)
    pendown()
```

<!-- Speaker note: What this step is for: In a for-each loop the name holds the item itself. Use it directly; asking the list for it again is a mistake. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: the trace shows c changing each pass. The bug task uses c as a place; ask what colours[c] would mean. -->

## What does c hold?

**Fill in what c holds on each pass.**

## Spot the bug

**This program should draw three circles, but it stops with an error. Click the line that causes it.**

```
 1  from turtle import *
 2  
 3  colours = ["red", "blue", "green"]
 4  
 5  for c in colours:
 6      pencolor(colours[c])
 7      circle(30)
```

* Answer: line 6

<!-- Speaker note: c is already a colour, such as "red". colours[c] asks for the item in place "red", which makes no sense. Use pencolor(c). -->

## Visit each <span style="font-size:.6em;color:#64748b">(5 min)</span>

One student walks along a row of colour cards and says what c holds at each. Compare with the index version from last lesson.

<!-- Speaker note: Make the idea physical before it goes back to the screen. -->

## Modify

Add two more colours to the list. Move the start so they all fit on the screen.

<!-- Speaker note: What this step is for: A longer list gives a longer result with no change to the loop, and you never count the items. Hints, in order: Each colour is a word in quotes, separated from the next by a comma. / Seven squares are wider than five. Move the start further left, with goto. For students who need more support: Give the loop with the first two passes traced, and ask the student to continue the table. For early finishers: Draw the bar chart with each bar a different colour, using a second list of colours alongside the heights. The hard part, on purpose: Remembering that c is the item, not its place. Ask what c holds on the first pass before running. When students get stuck: An error on the pencolor line inside the loop. Ask: What does c hold? Is it a place or a colour? Fix: c is already the colour. Use pencolor(c), not pencolor(colours[c]). / The bars all start in the same place and overlap. Ask: What does the turtle do after finishing one bar? Fix: Lift the pen and move forward past the bar before drawing the next one. / A student prefers range(len(...)). Ask: Do you need the place in this loop? Fix: If only the item matters, use for-each. Use the place when you need it, for example to pick from two lists at once. -->

<!-- Speaker note: This program goes through the scores and colours each bar. Work it out on paper before you check. What this step is for: Each item can be tested as it is visited: an if inside a for-each decides what to do with each one. -->

## Mix it up

**scores = [45, 72, 90, 38, 66] and pass_mark = 50. How many bars are green?**

* Answer: 3

<!-- Speaker note: 72, 90 and 66 are at least 50, so three bars are green. 45 and 38 are red. What this step is for: Each item can be tested as it is visited: an if inside a for-each decides what to do with each one. -->

## Make

Draw a **bar chart**: one bar for each number in `heights`, the height of the bar equal to the number.

<!-- Speaker note: Hints, in order: One bar for each number in the list: for h in heights does that, and each time round h is the next height. / A bar is a rectangle: forward(20), left(90), forward(h), left(90), forward(20), left(90), forward(h), left(90). Then move on before the next bar. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: the bar chart is the same loop with heights instead of colours. A bar is a rectangle whose tall side is the number. -->

## Change a rainfall chart

Each bar is a day's rain, Monday first. Put in a week of your own, or one from the weather news. Then make the heavy days (more than 15 mm) a darker blue with an `if` inside the loop, so you can spot them at a glance.
