Python Foundations with Turtle · Choices and lists

<!-- Speaker note: Students use the remainder, %, to make a decision repeat every second or third pass, and add a third choice with elif. About 30 minutes (Predict and Run 8 min · Investigate 10 min · Modify 7 min · Mix it up 5 min). The Run, Modify and Make slides have the live playground in them; the tutorial link under it is the backup. -->

## Today

**We are learning to** use the remainder, %, to pick every second or third pass, and add a third choice with elif.

- I can say what i % 2 gives and when it is 0.
- I can pick every second or every third pass of a loop.
- I can add a third choice with elif and say which check wins.

<!-- Speaker note: Before class: The new symbol is `%`, the **remainder** after dividing, not "percent". 7 % 2 is 1 (7 ÷ 2 is 3, remainder 1). Run the pattern and try `i % 3` yourself. Teacher: Mix it up: the first question is about which check wins when two are true. The second joins a name, the counter and the remainder. -->

---

## Why it matters

> Zebra crossings, chessboards, stripes and blinking lights all repeat a pattern: every second one is different.

<!-- Speaker note: Last lesson the program chose by comparing the counter with a number. A pattern that repeats needs a different question: is this pass an even one? -->

---

## By the end of this lesson

Here is the finished program running. By the end of the lesson you will write one like it.

<!-- Speaker note: Run the finished example on the projector before anything else. -->

## Predict

```python
from turtle import *

pensize(6)
for i in range(8):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        pencolor("red")
    else:
        pencolor("blue")
    forward(30)
    right(45)
```

**What colour are the sides, in order?**

- Red, blue, red, blue, and so on, taking turns
- Only the first side red, the rest blue
- Four red sides, then four blue sides
- Every side red

<!-- Speaker note: What happens: Red and blue take turns. i % 2 is the remainder after dividing i by 2: 0 for 0, 2, 4 and 6, and 1 for 1, 3, 5 and 7. The condition is true on every second pass. Take two or three predictions before anyone runs it. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: show the loop and take a vote. The wrong options are each a slip about what the condition picks: a half, everything, or only the first pass. -->

## What happened?

* Red and blue take turns. i % 2 is the remainder after dividing i by 2: 0 for 0, 2, 4 and 6, and 1 for 1, 3, 5 and 7. The condition is true on every second pass.

<!-- Speaker note: Reveal after running. Ask who predicted it, and what made them think so. -->

## Investigate

```python
from turtle import *

pensize(6)
for i in range(8):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        pencolor("red")
    else:
        pencolor("blue")
    forward(30)
    right(45)
```

<!-- Speaker note: What this step is for: The remainder repeats: 0, 1, 0, 1 for 2 and 0, 1, 2, 0, 1, 2 for 3. That repeat is what makes a pattern. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: students fill in the remainder table before running. Say that remainders repeat, and that the repeat is what makes a pattern. -->

## Modify

Make every **third** side green and keep the red and blue taking turns on the rest. Use `elif`.

<!-- Speaker note: What this step is for: A second question (elif) is asked only when the first answer was no, so it adds a choice without rewriting the rest. Hints, in order: Put the new check first, before the others. Python stops at the first true answer. / i % 3 == 0 is true for 0, 3 and 6. Use elif for the red check. For students who need more support: Give the remainder table with the first rows done, and ask the student to say each condition aloud before filling in the colour. For early finishers: Make a pattern that repeats every 4 sides with four colours, using % 4. The hard part, on purpose: Reading i % 2 as 'half' and the order of elif. Ask them to work out the remainder for i = 0, 1, 2, 3 before running. When students get stuck: A student reads i % 2 as 'half' or 'percent'. Ask: What is left over when 7 is divided by 2? Fix: % gives the remainder. 7 % 2 is 1, 8 % 2 is 0. / The third colour never appears, or appears in the wrong places. Ask: Which question does Python ask first? Fix: Put the i % 3 == 0 check first. Python stops at the first true answer. / A SyntaxError on the elif line. Ask: Does the elif line end in a colon, and is it lined up with the if? Fix: elif i % 2 == 0: lines up with if and ends in a colon. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: elif is a second question, asked only if the first answer was no. The order matters, so ask what happens if the i % 3 check goes last. -->

- Both: the side is drawn twice

* Answer: Green: the first true check wins

## Exit ticket

**A loop colours pass i red if i % 2 == 0, else blue. What colour is pass 5, and why?**

* Blue. 5 % 2 is 1, so the condition is false and the else path runs.

Where this leads: Next lesson keeps many values under one name, a list, so a pattern can pick from colours you choose. The remainder returns in Catch the turtle. -->
