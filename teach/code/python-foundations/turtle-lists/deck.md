# Lists

Python Foundations with Turtle · Choices and lists

<!-- Speaker note: Students keep many values in one list, pick one by its place, and count them with len, learning that places start at 0. About 30 minutes (Predict and Run 10 min · Investigate 10 min · Modify 6 min · Mix it up 4 min). The Run, Modify and Make slides have the live playground in them; the tutorial link under it is the backup. -->

---

## Today

- I can store several values in a list.
- I can find an item by its place, counting from 0.
- I can use len to count the items in a list.

<!-- Speaker note: Before class: Run the coloured shape. The idea to have ready: the first item in a list is in place **0**, so a list of 5 items has places 0 to 4. Asking for place 5 stops the program with an IndexError. Teacher: Mix it up: the turn is worked out from len, so it changes when the list does. -->

---

## Why it matters

> A class roll keeps every name in order, under one heading.

<!-- Speaker note: Names hold one value. A **list** holds many, in order, under a single name. You pick one by its place. -->

---

## By the end of this lesson

Here is the finished program running. By the end of the lesson you will write one like it.

<!-- Speaker note: Run the finished example on the projector before anything else. -->

## Predict

```python
from turtle import *

colours = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue"]

pensize(8)
for i in range(len(colours)):
    pencolor(colours[i])
    forward(50)
    right(72)
```

**What colour is the third side?**

- orange
- yellow
- red
- green

<!-- Speaker note: What happens: Yellow. The third pass has i = 2, and colours[2] is the item in place 2. Places count from 0, so place 0 is red, place 1 is orange and place 2 is yellow. Take two or three predictions before anyone runs it. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: ask what colour the third side is. Many say orange: they count the places from 1. Do not correct it yet; run it and let the picture do the work. -->

## What happened?

* Yellow. The third pass has i = 2, and colours[2] is the item in place 2. Places count from 0, so place 0 is red, place 1 is orange and place 2 is yellow.

<!-- Speaker note: Reveal after running. Ask who predicted it, and what made them think so. -->

## Investigate

```python
from turtle import *

colours = ["red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue"]

pensize(8)
for i in range(len(colours)):
    pencolor(colours[i])
    forward(50)
    right(72)
```

<!-- Speaker note: What this step is for: A list is numbered from 0, so the last place is one less than the length, and asking for a place that does not exist stops the program. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: students say which item is in each place before running. The number question is the same idea backwards: the last place is one less than the length. -->

## Spot the bug

**This program should draw three circles, but it stops with an error. Click the line that causes it.**

```
 1  from turtle import *
 2  
 3  colours = ["red", "blue", "green"]
 4  
 5  for i in range(4):
 6      pencolor(colours[i])
 7      circle(20 + i * 10)
```

* Answer: line 6

<!-- Speaker note: The loop runs four times, so on the last time it asks for colours[3]. The list has only places 0, 1 and 2. range(len(colours)) would always match the list. -->

## Modify



- **Add two colours:** Put two more colours into the list and run it. Does the loop need to change?
- **Change the first colour:** Replace the first colour (place 0) with "pink".

<!-- Speaker note: What this step is for: Changing a list changes the whole result with no change to the loop, which is why the data and the instructions are kept apart. Hints, in order: Each colour is a word in quotes, separated from the next by a comma. / Replace the first word in the list. Nothing else changes. / The first item is colours[0]. The loop still uses it first. For students who need more support: Give students the list on paper with the places written under each item, and ask them to point to colours[2] before running the program. For early finishers: Make a second list of sizes and use sizes[i] alongside colours[i], so each side has its own colour and length. The hard part, on purpose: Places start at 0, so the last place is one less than the length. Ask how many items there are and what the last place number is. When students get stuck: An IndexError: list index out of range. Ask: How many items are in the list, and what is the last place number? Fix: The last place is one less than the length. Loop with range(len(colours)) so the count always matches. / A NameError, or the colour name is printed instead of used. Ask: Does every colour have quotes round it, with commas between them? Fix: Text in a list needs quotes: ["red", "blue"]. / A student expects colours[1] to be red. Ask: What is the place of the very first item? Fix: The first place is 0. colours[0] is red, colours[1] is orange. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: adding colours changes the picture without touching the loop. Ask why that is useful (the data changes, the instructions do not). -->

Two lists work together here: `heights[i]` and `colours[i]` are the same place on the podium. Make the winner's block taller, then add a fourth place, with a height and a colour of its own. Does the loop need to change?

Playlists, class rolls and leaderboards are lists. -->
