# Functions with parameters

Python functions and events · Functions

<!-- Speaker note: Students give a function inputs (parameters), so one function can draw many sizes and shapes, then build a pattern by calling one function from another. About 55 minutes (Predict and Run 10 min · Investigate 15 min · Modify 15 min · Make 10 min · My tools 5 min). The Run, Modify and Make slides have the live playground in them; the tutorial link under it is the backup. -->

---

## Today

- I can write a function with parameters and call it with different values.
- I can explain the difference between a parameter (the name in the def) and an argument (the value in the call).
- I can call one function from inside another.

<!-- Speaker note: Before class: Run the three nested squares and try adding a colour parameter to `polygon`. Two words to have straight: a **parameter** is the name in the def (`size`), an **argument** is the value you pass when calling (`50`). The argument fills the parameter, in order. Teacher: My tools: students save a function to My tools in the Reference panel. It is a copy they can paste into later programs. -->

---

## Why it matters

> One well-made function can do the work of a hundred copied lines: sending a message, drawing a tile, converting a unit.

<!-- Speaker note: Last lesson `square()` always drew the same size. A **parameter** lets each call say what it needs. -->

## Predict

```python
from turtle import *


def square(size):
    for i in range(4):
        forward(size)
        right(90)


square(50)
square(100)
square(150)
```

`size` is a parameter. What will this draw? Where do the three squares share a corner, and why?

<!-- Speaker note: Take two or three predictions before anyone runs it. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: ask why the three squares share a corner. They all start where the turtle is, facing the same way; only size changes. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Run it and compare it with your prediction. Then call `square` with other sizes. Students should be able to say: I can explain how square(50) and square(150) draw different squares from the same def. -->

## Investigate

```python
from turtle import *


def polygon(sides, size):
    angle = 360 / sides
    for i in range(sides):
        forward(size)
        right(angle)


polygon(3, 80)
polygon(4, 80)
polygon(6, 80)
```

<!-- Speaker note: `polygon(sides, size)` has two parameters. The angle is calculated from `sides`, just like in the variables lesson. What this step is for: A parameter lets one function make many results: each call passes arguments in order, and the function calculates from them. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: arguments go to parameters in order. polygon(6, 80) fills sides with 6 and size with 80. Swapping them gives an 80-sided shape. -->

## Trace three calls

<div class="side" style="display:grid;grid-template-columns:1fr 1fr;gap:1em">

```python
from turtle import *


def polygon(sides, size):
    angle = 360 / sides
    for i in range(sides):

        right(angle)


polygon(3, 80)
polygon(4, 80)
polygon(6, 80)

**Fill in what each call passes to polygon(sides, size), and the angle it calculates.**

| call | sides | size | angle |

| polygon(3, 80) | 3 | 80 | ? |
| polygon(4, 80) | 4 | 80 | ? |
| polygon(6, 80) | ? | ? | ? |

## Name the parts

<div class="side" style="display:grid;grid-template-columns:1fr 1fr;gap:1em">

**Match each piece with its role.**

| | |
|---|---|
| `sides in def polygon(sides, size):` | A. calculated inside the function |
| `6 in polygon(6, 80)` | B. a call: runs the function with these values |
| `angle = 360 / sides` | C. an argument: the value for sides |
| `polygon(4, 80)` | D. a parameter: filled in by each call |

* Answer: sides in def polygon(sides, size): → D. a parameter: filled in by each call; 6 in polygon(6, 80) → C. an argument: the value for sides; angle = 360 / sides → A. calculated inside the function; polygon(4, 80) → B. a call: runs the function with these values

## Modify



- **Draw one more shape:** Call `polygon` with sides and size of your choice.
- **Add a colour parameter:** Change `polygon` so each call can choose its own pen colour, like `polygon(3, 80, "red")`.

<!-- Speaker note: What this step is for: Extending a function means changing its definition and every call; it shows why parameters are a contract between the def and its callers. Hints, in order: Add a line like polygon(8, 50) at the bottom. / A new parameter goes in the brackets of the def, and a new value goes in every call. / Inside the function, `pencolor(...)` takes the value of your new parameter. For students who need more support: Give students a table of calls (square(50), square(100)) and ask them to sketch what each draws before running. For early finishers: Add a third parameter to pattern for the size, and draw a gallery of three different patterns side by side. The hard part, on purpose: Arguments fill parameters in order. Read the call and the def aloud side by side and match each value to its name. When students get stuck: A TypeError: polygon() missing 1 required positional argument. Ask: How many parameters does the def have, and how many values does this call pass? Fix: Every call must pass one value for each parameter, in the same order. / The shape has far too many sides or does not close. Ask: Which value went into sides, and which into size? Fix: Arguments match parameters by position. polygon(6, 80), not polygon(80, 6). / The pattern draws one shape on top of itself. Ask: Does the turtle turn between the copies? Fix: Add right(360 / copies) inside the loop, after drawing each polygon. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: adding a colour parameter means changing the def and every call. That is the 'contract' between a function and its callers. -->

## Mix it up

**What is the turn in degrees for polygon(8, 50)?**

* Answer: 45

<!-- Speaker note: The turn is 360 / sides, and sides is 8, so 360 / 8 = 45. The size does not change the turn. What this step is for: A parameter can be used in a calculation, like any name. -->

## Make

Write `def pattern(sides, copies):` that draws `copies` polygons, turning a little between them so they fan out around a point.

<!-- Speaker note: Hints, in order: Use a loop to repeat. Inside it, call polygon, then turn a little. / To go round once in total, each turn is 360 divided by the number of copies. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: pattern calls polygon in a loop and turns a little each time. Set speed(0) so it draws quickly. -->
