# Optional: Control panel

Python functions and events · Final challenge: Catch the turtle

<!-- Speaker note: An optional lesson in the user interface direction. Students turn the game into an app with rows of buttons built from lists, so adding a control means adding to a list. About 45 minutes (Predict, Run and Investigate 15 min · Difficulty row 15 min · Your own controls 15 min). The Run, Modify and Make slides have the live playground in them; the tutorial link under it is the backup. -->

## Today

**We are learning to** turn the game into an app with a panel of buttons made from lists.

- I can draw a row of buttons from lists with a loop.
- I can find which button was clicked with a loop.
- I can add a control to an app by adding to its lists.

<!-- Speaker note: Before class: The big idea: **buttons are data**. Three lists (the names, the positions, the values) and two loops (one draws the buttons, one checks which was clicked) replace a pile of copied if statements. "New game" waits 1.1 seconds before starting: that lets any timer still running from the last game stop first, so two games never run at once. Teacher: Ask: what goes wrong if names has four items but bxs has three? (The loop asks for a position that does not exist.) -->

---

## Why it matters

> Every app is a panel of controls over some state. Build the panel from data, and adding a control is one more item in a list.

<!-- Speaker note: Your game has one button. Real apps have panels: rows of controls that change what the program does. Here the buttons come from **lists**, so a loop draws them and a loop finds which one was clicked. -->

## Predict

_The program is 106 lines long: open it in the tutorial and read it together._

[Open this step](https://tutorials.learningwaypoints.com/code/python-functions/turtle-panel/?full=step-1#step-1)

**You click at x = 0 on the row of buttons. Which button is pressed?**

- Pause
- Go
- New game
- None of them

<!-- Speaker note: What happens: Pause: its button starts at bxs[1] = -60 and is 120 wide, so it covers x from -60 to 60. Take two or three predictions before anyone runs it. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: the Pause button covers x from -60 to 60, so a click at x = 0 presses Pause. -->

## Investigate

_The program is 106 lines long: open it in the tutorial and read it together._

[Open this step](https://tutorials.learningwaypoints.com/code/python-functions/turtle-panel/?full=step-3#step-3)

<!-- Speaker note: What this step is for: Controls stored as data are drawn and checked by loops, so the panel grows by adding to lists, not by copying code. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: follow the loop for a click at x = 100. Only the third button matches. -->

## Follow a click

**A click at x = 100, y = -170. Follow the loop in clicked.**

| i | bxs[i] | inside? |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | -190 | no |
| 1 | ? | ? |
| 2 | ? | ? |

* Answer: -60, no, 70, yes

<!-- Speaker note: Only the third button covers x = 100 (it runs from 70 to 190), so press("Go") runs. -->

## Keep the lists in step

**You add a fourth name to names but forget to add a position to bxs. What happens?**

- Nothing changes
- An error: the loop asks for bxs[3], which does not exist
- The button appears at x = 0
- Python adds a position for you

* Answer: An error: the loop asks for bxs[3], which does not exist

<!-- Speaker note: The loops go up to len(names), so they ask for a fourth position. Parallel lists must stay the same length. -->

## difficulty row

Add a second row: **Easy**, **Medium** and **Hard**. Each one sets how fast the turtle hops. Three more lists, two more loops.

<!-- Speaker note: Hints, in order: Three new lists: levels = ["Easy", "Medium", "Hard"], lxs = [-190, -60, 70], delays = [1300, 1000, 700]. / Copy the drawing loop in draw_scene, but use levels, lxs and y = -140. / Copy the checking loop in clicked: when a level is clicked, delay = delays[i] (and add delay to the global line). For students who need more support: Give the difficulty row's three lists already written; students add only the two loops. For early finishers: Add a row that chooses between two different paths (two pairs of lists) for the turtle. The hard part, on purpose: Controls stored as lists that must stay the same length. Ask them to count each list's items when an IndexError appears. When students get stuck: An IndexError when clicking or drawing. Ask: Do all the lists that go together have the same number of items? Fix: Lists used side by side (names and bxs) must be the same length. / Two rows of buttons overlap. Ask: What y value does each row use? Fix: Give each row its own y, at least 50 apart for 40-high buttons. / A click changes the difficulty but the turtle still moves at the old speed. Ask: Is delay in the global line of clicked? Fix: Add delay to clicked's global line. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: the difficulty row is the same pattern again: three lists, a drawing loop and a checking loop. -->

## Make: your own controls

Add a row of controls you design. **Where this leads:** in Gradio, you list the controls (`gr.Button`, `gr.Radio`) and Gradio draws them and checks the clicks for you. On a web page, HTML draws the buttons and JavaScript listens for clicks. You have just built what both of them do.

<!-- Speaker note: Hints, in order: A theme row: names like "Day" and "Night" with a list of colours, and bgcolor(colours[i]) when one is clicked. / A path chooser: two pairs of lists, and a button that swaps which pair xs and ys use. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: students design a row of their own. A colour theme with bgcolor is a good first choice. -->

## Exit ticket

**A panel has names = ["A", "B", "C"] and bxs = [-190, -60, 70], each button 120 wide. Which button does a click at x = -100 press?**

* A. Its button runs from -190 to -70, and -100 is inside that range.

<!-- Speaker note: Students answer on paper or a mini whiteboard before the reveal. Anyone who cannot answer needs the main idea again next lesson. Where this leads: Gradio lets you list controls (gr.Button, gr.Radio) and draws them and checks clicks for you. On a web page, HTML draws the buttons and JavaScript listens for clicks. Students have built what both do. -->
