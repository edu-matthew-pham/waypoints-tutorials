# Functions that give answers

Python functions and events · Functions

<!-- Speaker note: Students write functions that give an answer back with return, see why print is not the same, and combine small functions to build a street. About 55 minutes (Predict and Run 10 min · Investigate 15 min · Modify 10 min · Make 15 min · Street 5 min). The Run, Modify and Make slides have the live playground in them; the tutorial link under it is the backup. -->

## Today

**We are learning to** return a value, combine functions, and use them inside loops.

- I can write a function that gives a value back with return.
- I can explain the difference between return (hand the value back) and print (only show it).
- I can build a program from several small functions working together.

<!-- Speaker note: Before class: Read the unit primer first. The one idea to be clear on: `print` shows a value on the screen, but the program cannot use it; `return` hands the value back to the line that called the function, so it can be used, like `forward(metres(5))`. Try the bug task yourself: it stops with a TypeError because a function without return gives back `None` (Python's word for "nothing"). Teacher: Street: the loop varies the size argument, so each house is different. Ask how to make them shrink instead of grow. -->

---

## Why it matters

> Calculators, maps and games are full of functions that take something in and give an answer back.

<!-- Speaker note: You can write functions that draw. Now you will write functions that **give an answer back**, and combine several functions to build something bigger. -->

## Predict

```python
from turtle import *

scale = 20


def metres(m):
    return m * scale


forward(metres(5))
right(90)
forward(metres(3))
```

`metres(5)` gives back a number. What do you think `forward(metres(5))` does? How far will the turtle move, and how far does the second `forward` take it?

<!-- Speaker note: Take two or three predictions before anyone runs it. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: metres(5) is replaced by its answer, 100, so forward(metres(5)) is forward(100). Write this substitution on the board. -->

## forward(metres(5)) runs in two steps

```mermaid

  accTitle: forward(metres(5)) runs in two steps
  accDescr: A sequence of calls. Your program calls metres(5). metres works out 5 times 20 and returns 100 to your program. Then your program calls forward(100), and the turtle moves 100.
  participant P as Your program
  participant M as metres
  participant F as forward

## Investigate

```python
from turtle import *

scale = 20


def metres(m):
    return m * scale


print(metres(5))
forward(metres(5))
right(90)
forward(metres(3))
```

<!-- Speaker note: `print(metres(5))` shows the answer under the drawing. Change `scale` and watch both the printed value and the drawing change. What this step is for: return hands a value back so other code can use it; print only shows it. Knowing the difference is what makes functions reusable. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: work out metres(5) before running. Then do the bug task and ask why the number is printed but the turtle still fails. -->

## Spot the bug

**This version prints 100, then stops with a TypeError on the last line. Click the line that causes it.**

 5  
 6  def metres(m):

 8

10  forward(metres(5))
```

* Answer: line 7

<!-- Speaker note: print(m * scale) shows the value but does not give it back. It should be return m * scale. -->

## Explain return

**What does the word return do in metres?**

- It draws the shape again
- It prints the answer
- It gives the answer back to the code that called the function
- It stops the program

* Answer: It gives the answer back to the code that called the function

## Modify

`room` calls `metres` to turn sizes into pixels. Functions are working together here.

- **Write area:** Write `def area(width, depth)` that **returns** the area.
- **Print the area:** Print the area of the room that the program draws.

<!-- Speaker note: What this step is for: A function that returns a value can be combined with other code, and functions can call each other. Hints, in order: Your function should work out the answer and give it back with return, not print it. / The area of a room is its width times its depth. / Call your function inside print(...), for example print(area(5, 4)). For students who need more support: Before the Make step, write the one-house function together on the board, then let students add the loop themselves. For early finishers: Write a function that returns the perimeter of a room, then print the area and perimeter of three rooms. The hard part, on purpose: return versus print: both show a number, but only return hands it back. Let the NoneType error happen, then ask what the function gives back. When students get stuck: A TypeError mentioning NoneType, often on a forward line. Ask: Does the function return its answer, or only print it? Fix: Replace print(...) inside the function with return ..., then use the value where it is needed. / The area is worked out but nothing appears. Ask: Where is the returned value used or shown? Fix: A returned value has to be used. Print it outside the function, print(area(5, 4)). / Code after return never runs. Ask: What happens at the moment a function reaches return? Fix: return ends the function. Put any other lines before it. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: area returns width * depth. Students print it to see it; the room drawing does not change. -->

## Mix it up

**What does label(50) give back?**

- 50
- big
- nothing
- small

* Answer: small

<!-- Speaker note: 50 > 50 is False, because 50 is not more than 50. So the else path runs and the function returns "small". What this step is for: A function with an if returns one answer per call: whichever path runs decides it. -->

## Make a street

This time there is no starter. Build the street in two stages.

- **Draw one house:** Write a function that draws one house.
- **Draw five in a row:** Use a loop to repeat it for a **street of five houses**.

<!-- Speaker note: What this step is for: Written without a starter, this shows whether a student can define, call and repeat a function on their own. Hints, in order: Write a function that draws one house, with a size parameter. / A loop calls your function five times. A new size for each house can come from the loop variable. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: there is no starter on purpose. This shows whether students can write and use a function on their own. Give the hint only after a real attempt. -->

## Exit ticket

**def double(n): return n * 2. What does forward(double(30)) do?**

* double(30) gives back 60, so the turtle moves forward 60 steps.

<!-- Speaker note: Students answer on paper or a mini whiteboard before the reveal. Anyone who cannot answer needs the main idea again next lesson.

Calculators, maps and games are full of functions that take something in and give an answer back.
