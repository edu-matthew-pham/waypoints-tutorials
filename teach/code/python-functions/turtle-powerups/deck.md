# Power-ups

Python functions and events · Final challenge: Catch the turtle

<!-- Speaker note: The second half of the final challenge. Students add lives, a status bar, a gold turtle worth 5 and an upgrade bought with points, then invent a power-up of their own. About 60 minutes (Predict, Run and Investigate 15 min · Status bar 10 min · Gold turtle 10 min · Upgrade 10 min · Your own power-up 15 min). The Run, Modify and Make slides have the live playground in them; the tutorial link under it is the backup. -->

## Today

- I can tell which parts of a program are the user interface and which are the rules.
- I can write a function with four parameters and use it several times.
- I can add a rule that costs something, and explain why the cost is fair.

<!-- Speaker note: Before class: This lesson mixes both directions students could take next. The **user interface** is what the player sees and uses (the status bar, the buttons); the **rules** decide what each event means (losing a life, gold is worth 5, an upgrade costs 5). The Investigate task sorts parts into the two kinds. Try the upgrade task yourself: it uses a variable `delay` instead of the fixed 1000 milliseconds. Teacher: Status bar: one function, label(x, y, name, value), called three times. Ask what the alternative would be (copying six lines three times). Teacher: Gold turtle: every third spot is gold, using % from Every other. The gold circle is drawn under the turtle. Teacher: Upgrade: the button only works if score >= 5. Ask what happens without that check (scores go negative). Teacher: Your own power-up: students write one sentence at the top explaining why its cost is fair. Share a few. -->

---

## Why it matters

> Games and apps are built from the same parts: buttons that change state, and rules about what each change means.

<!-- Speaker note: Your game works. Now make it richer: lives instead of misses, a proper status bar, a gold turtle worth more, and an upgrade that costs points. Each one is a small change to the program you already have. -->

## Predict

[Open this step](https://tutorials.learningwaypoints.com/code/python-functions/turtle-powerups/?full=step-1#step-1)

**You start a game and miss three turtles in a row. What happens?**

- Lives goes below 0 and the game carries on
- Lives goes 3, 2, 1, 0 and the game stops with the Start button back
- Nothing: misses are not counted
- The game ends after the first miss

<!-- Speaker note: What happens: Each miss takes a life. At 0, playing becomes False, so hop stops and the Start button is drawn again. Take two or three predictions before anyone runs it. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: each miss takes a life; at 0 lives the game stops. Point to the line that ends the game. -->

<!-- Speaker note: Look at the program again: which lines draw things the player sees, and which lines decide what happens?

<!-- Speaker note: Teacher: discuss the match before checking it. 'Both' (a button that costs points) is the interesting one. -->

## Investigate

**Each part of a game is user interface, a game rule, or both. Match them.**

| | |
|---|---|
| `The status bar showing score, lives and time` | A. user interface: the player acts |
| `The Start button` | B. user interface: shows the state |
| `Losing a life when a turtle escapes` | C. game rule: what an event means |
| `A gold turtle worth 5 points` | D. game rule: a reward |
| `A button that costs 5 points to use` | E. both: a control that follows a rule |

* Answer: The status bar showing score, lives and time → B. user interface: shows the state; The Start button → A. user interface: the player acts; Losing a life when a turtle escapes → C. game rule: what an event means; A gold turtle worth 5 points → D. game rule: a reward; A button that costs 5 points to use → E. both: a control that follows a rule

<!-- Speaker note: Apps are mostly user interface around some rules; games are mostly rules with some user interface. You are building both. What this step is for: The same program has two kinds of parts: the user interface (show the state, let the player act) and the rules (what each event means). Naming them is the first step to both app and game design. -->

## Add the power-ups



- **Status bar:** Write `label(x, y, name, value)` and use it to show **Score**, **Lives** and **Time** across the top. One function, three calls.
- **Gold turtle:** Every third spot, the turtle is gold: draw a gold circle under it, and make catching it worth **5**.
- **Upgrade button:** While playing, the button says **Slow (5)**. Clicking it spends 5 points and slows the turtle down by 200 milliseconds, but only if you can afford it.

<!-- Speaker note: Hints, in order: def label(x, y, name, value): goto(x, y), write(name), goto(x + 55, y), write(value). / In draw_scene: label(-190, 160, "Score", score), then Lives at -50 and Time at 90. / In hop, after place changes: if place % 3 == 0: gold = True, else: gold = False. / In draw_scene: if showing and gold: goto(tx, ty) then dot(50, "gold"). In clicked: if gold: score = score + 5, else: score = score + 1. / Add delay = 1000 with the other variables, set it back to 1000 in start(), and use ontimer(hop, delay) and ontimer(hide, delay - 300). / In clicked: if playing and score >= 5 and inside(x, y, -60, -180, 120, 40): take 5 points, add 200 to delay, draw_scene(). For students who need more support: Do the status bar together, then let students choose either the gold turtle or the upgrade rather than both. For early finishers: Add a power-up that makes the catch box bigger for 10 seconds, then switches back by itself (a timer). The hard part, on purpose: Separating the rules from the display, and the check before buying. Ask what must be true before the player can buy, before they write the if. When students get stuck: The upgrade can be bought with 0 points and the score goes negative. Ask: What should be true before the player can buy it? Fix: Add score >= 5 to the if that checks the button. / The gold circle stays on screen after the turtle moves on. Ask: When is the gold circle drawn, and what clears it? Fix: Draw it only when showing and gold are both True, and redraw (draw_scene) after a catch or a hide. / The upgrade button seems to do nothing. Ask: Does hop() use delay, or still the number 1000? Fix: Use ontimer(hop, delay) and ontimer(hide, delay - 300). -->

Invent a power-up of your own. Decide what it does, what it costs and when it can be used, then build it. Write one sentence (as a comment at the top) that explains why the cost is fair.

<!-- Speaker note: Hints, in order: More time: a button that costs 10 points and adds 5 to time_left. / Bigger catch box: a power-up that makes the box 60 by 60 instead of 40 by 40 (remember to centre it: tx - 30). / Double points: a variable that doubles every catch until the next game. -->
