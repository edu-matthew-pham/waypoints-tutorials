# A shared code

**Name:** {{field-24}} **Date:** {{field-15}} **Class:** {{field-15}}

> **Key question:** Morse code works because both ends agree what each pattern means. So does this.


:::teacher-note

**In one sentence:** Students send a place number that stands for a word in a list both micro:bits share, and see that a message is a code both sides must agree on.

**Students should be able to say:** I can send a place number and look up the word it stands for. I can explain why both micro:bits need the same list in the same order. I can step through a list with a button and loop back to the start.

**Width:** the unmarked parts are the floor every student does (predict, run, investigate and make). Typical adds the modify practice; wider adds the real-world contexts. They add contexts, not difficulty. Students work in the online tutorial alongside this sheet.

## Predict

The receiver shows **get value at receivedNumber**: the word at the place that arrived.

:::keep-together

**You press A on one micro:bit, so it sends 2. What does the other micro:bit show?**

☐ Hi

☐ No

☐ Yes

☐ 2

My prediction, and why:

{{lines-3}}

:::


:::teacher-note

**What happens:** No. The receiver looks up place 2 in its list: Hi is at 0, Yes at 1, No at 2.

:::


## Run

Run the program in the tutorial. Was your prediction right? What was different?

{{lines-2}}

## Investigate

**A** steps through the list; **B** sends the place number of the chosen word.

### Choose and send

**This messenger lets you choose a word with A, then send it with B. Fill in choice after each press of A.**

{{rows 1}}

| press | choice after | word shown |
|---|---|---|
| (start) | 0 |  |
| A |   |   |
| A |   |   |
| A |   |   |

:::


:::teacher-note

**Answer:** 1, Yes, 2, No, 0, Hi

Each A adds 1. When choice reaches 3 (the length of the list), the if sets it back to 0, so it loops round the list.

### Ella and Tom

Ella's list:

Tom's list:

![The program as blocks](https://tutorials.learningwaypoints.com/_pictures/makecode/code/85e2f3d04579.png?v=0060d7492e3d079a)

**Ella and Tom built the messenger, but Tom's list is in a different order. Ella sends Yes, and Tom's micro:bit shows No. Why?**

☐ Tom's group is wrong

☐ Only the place number is sent, and the same place holds a different word in Tom's list

☐ Lists cannot be sent by radio

☐ The radio changed the number

:::


:::teacher-note

**Answer:** Only the place number is sent, and the same place holds a different word in Tom's list

Ella sends place 1. In her list place 1 is Yes; in Tom's it is No. Both micro:bits must use the same list in the same order.

:::


:::keep-together

### Why a number?

**Why send the place number instead of the whole word?**

☐ Both micro:bits already have the list, so a small number is all that needs to travel

☐ Radio cannot send words

☐ It is the only block that works

☐ Numbers are prettier

:::


:::teacher-note

**Answer:** Both micro:bits already have the list, so a small number is all that needs to travel

Radio can send words, but a number is shorter and both sides already know what it stands for. That shared list is a code.

## Modify


**One more word.** Add a fourth word. Did you need to change anything else? Why not?

**Got it!.** Make the receiver **reply**: when a word arrives, it sends back 99, and the sender shows a tick when 99 arrives. Real messaging apps do this to show "delivered".

Work in the tutorial. Plan first: what will you change, and how will you test it?

:::teacher-note

**One possible solution.** Other correct programs are fine; check that the program runs and does what the task asks.

**One more word:**

## Mix it up

:::keep-together

**What does this receiver show for each number that arrives?**

{{rows 1}}

| receivedNumber | shows |
|---|---|
| 1 |   |
| 2 |   |
| 5 |   |

:::


:::teacher-note

**Answer:** happy face, sad face, cross

5 is more than 3, so the first part runs. 2 is not more than 3, but it is more than 1. 1 is neither, so else runs.

:::


## Make

Make a **mood check-in** for the start of class. Each student's micro:bit has a list of moods (at least three). **A** steps through them, **B** sends the chosen one, and the teacher's micro:bit shows it.

Work in the tutorial. Plan first: what will you change, and how will you test it?

## Change a quiz buzzer

This buzzer lets you pick an answer, A, B or C, and send it to the quiz master. Add a fourth answer, D, then make the quiz master's micro:bit show a tick after each answer arrives.

Work in the tutorial. Plan first: what will you change, and how will you test it?

## Exit ticket

:::keep-together

**Your micro:bit sends 1. Your list is Hi, Yes, No. Your partner's list is Yes, No, Hi. What does your partner's micro:bit show, and why?**

{{lines-3}}

:::


:::teacher-note

**Answer:** No. Only the place number travels, and place 1 in your partner's list is No.
