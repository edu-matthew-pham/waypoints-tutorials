:::keep-together

**on game update**: Runs its blocks every frame, about 30 times a second. Put an if here to keep checking something. Game.

![on game update](https://tutorials.learningwaypoints.com/_pictures/makecode/arcade/on-game-update.png?v=27a42bce11c5e88b)

```makecode
game.onUpdate(function () {
    blocks
})
```

:::keep-together

**if**: Runs the blocks inside only when the condition is true. Logic.

![if](https://tutorials.learningwaypoints.com/_pictures/makecode/arcade/if.png?v=72087ebc2d4bdc6c)

```makecode
if (condition) {
    blocks
}
```

:::keep-together

**check every frame**: An if inside on game update is asked every frame, so it acts the moment its question becomes true.

![check every frame](https://tutorials.learningwaypoints.com/_pictures/makecode/arcade/check-every-frame.png?v=b47aced8fa3d060f)

```makecode
game.onUpdate(function () {
    if (car.x > 160) {
        car.x = 0
    }
})
```

**jump**: A jump is a speed upwards (negative vy); gravity slows it and brings the sprite back down.

```makecode
mySprite.vy = -150
