# Lists

> The blocks from this unit. Find each one in the MakeCode toolbox (the category is at the end of each line).

:::keep-together

**list**: Many values in order under one name. Places start at 0. Advanced › Arrays.

![list](https://tutorials.learningwaypoints.com/_pictures/makecode/list.png?v=ee34909f625f5a53)

```makecode
let answers = ["Yes", "No"]
```

:::

:::keep-together

**get value at**: The item at a place in the list, counted from 0. Arrays.

![get value at](https://tutorials.learningwaypoints.com/_pictures/makecode/get-value-at.png?v=a1cc5a095ef3b5eb)

```makecode
answers[0]
```

:::

:::keep-together

**length of list**: How many items are in the list. The last place is the length − 1. Arrays.

![length of list](https://tutorials.learningwaypoints.com/_pictures/makecode/length-of-list.png?v=cacaaf90f3d9f82b)

```makecode
answers.length
```

:::

:::keep-together

**pick random**: A random whole number from the first to the second, both included. Math.

![pick random](https://tutorials.learningwaypoints.com/_pictures/makecode/pick-random.png?v=4481696167f9ec86)

```makecode
randint(0, 10)
```

:::

:::keep-together

**pick from list**: A random place from 0 to length − 1 reaches every item, however long the list grows.

![pick from list](https://tutorials.learningwaypoints.com/_pictures/makecode/pick-from-list.png?v=5874002626656e7b)

```makecode
basic.showString(list[randint(0, list.length - 1)])
```

:::

:::keep-together

**shared code**: Send a place number; both micro:bits must hold the same list in the same order.

![shared code](https://tutorials.learningwaypoints.com/_pictures/makecode/shared-code.png?v=c62759be1085673d)

```makecode
let words = ["Hi", "Yes", "No"]
radio.onReceivedNumber(function (receivedNumber) {
    basic.showString(words[receivedNumber])
})
```
