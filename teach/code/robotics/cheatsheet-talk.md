**play melody**: Plays notes on the micro:bit: a letter for each note, - for a rest, at a speed in beats per minute. Until done waits for the tune to end; in background moves on at once. Music › play melody.

```makecode
music.play(music.stringPlayable("C D E F G A B C5", 120), music.PlaybackMode.UntilDone)
```

:::

:::keep-together

**play tone**: Plays one note on the micro:bit for a number of beats. In background, so the program carries on. Music › play tone.

![play tone](https://tutorials.learningwaypoints.com/_pictures/makecode/play-tone.png?v=0e134e007839e702)

```makecode
music.play(music.tonePlayable(262, music.beat(BeatFraction.Whole)), music.PlaybackMode.InBackground)
```

:::keep-together

**radio set group**: Picks a channel (0 to 255). Only micro:bits in the same group hear each other. Radio.

![radio set group](https://tutorials.learningwaypoints.com/_pictures/makecode/radio-set-group.png?v=c4ad40541593e499)

```makecode
radio.setGroup(1)

:::

:::keep-together

**radio send number**: Sends a number to every other micro:bit in the group. Radio.

```makecode
radio.sendNumber(0)
```

:::

:::keep-together

**on radio received**: Runs each time a number arrives; receivedNumber holds it. Radio.

![on radio received](https://tutorials.learningwaypoints.com/_pictures/makecode/on-radio-received.png?v=d78e5c441ffede02)

```makecode
radio.onReceivedNumber(function (receivedNumber) {
    blocks
})
```

:::

:::keep-together

**which message**: One on radio received gets every message; receivedNumber says which one arrived.

![which message](https://tutorials.learningwaypoints.com/_pictures/makecode/which-message.png?v=fdaaac2c254ff19c)

```makecode
radio.onReceivedNumber(function (receivedNumber) {
    if (receivedNumber == 1) {
        blocks
    } else if (receivedNumber == 2) {
        blocks
    }
})
```
