Last lesson you drew digits by writing every command one after another. A square written that way takes eight lines. There is a shorter way.

## Predict

```step
stage: predict
code: square.py#loop
reveal: true
check:
  type: predict
  q: "What will the turtle draw?"
  options: ["a square", "one long line", "one side, then a turn", "nothing, because i is never used"]
  fault: logic
  misconception: loop-body-indent
  actual: "A square. The two indented lines run 4 times: a side of 100, then a quarter turn, four times over. The turtle finishes where it started, facing right."
app: true
clip:
  - caption: The turtle starts in the middle, facing right.
  - type:
      into: Python code
      text: "@square.py#loop"
  - click: Run
  - expect: { selector: "#status", contains: Finished }
  - expect: { selector: "#turtle-state", contains: "heading 0" }
```

The line `for i in range(4):` is new. Read the code. What will the turtle draw?

## Run

```step
stage: run
code: square.py#loop
try: { starter: "square.py#loop", height: 420 }
```

Run the program and compare it with your prediction. Which lines ran four times?

Here is what each line does.

| Line | What it does | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `for i in range(4):` | Starts a loop that runs four times | `range(4)` counts 0, 1, 2, 3: one run each |
| `    forward(100)` | Draws a side | It is indented, so it is part of the loop |
| `    right(90)` | Turns a quarter turn | Also indented, so it repeats too |

Without the loop, the same square is eight lines. The loop writes the pattern once, and the count is a number you can change.

## Investigate

```step
stage: investigate
code: square.py#compare
insight: "Repetition has a cost: without a loop the code grows with every side, and a loop does the same work with a number you can change."
app: true
clip:
  - type:
      into: Python code
      text: "@square.py#loop"
  - click: Run
  - expect: { selector: "#status", contains: Finished }
tasks:
  - check:
      type: number
      q: "A square drawn one command at a time uses 8 lines of drawing code. A 20-sided shape drawn the same way would use how many lines?"
      answer: 40
      explain: "Each side needs 2 lines (forward and a turn), so 20 sides need 40."
  - check:
      type: bug
      code: square.py#bug
      text: "This was meant to draw a square. Instead the turtle draws one long line and turns once at the very end. Click the wrong line."
      answer: 5
      fault: logic
      misconception: loop-body-indent
      explain: "right(90) is not indented, so it is not part of the loop. The loop draws four sides in a straight line, and the turn runs once afterwards. Indent it under the for line so both lines repeat."
  - check:
      type: trace
      slideCode: square.py#loop
      text: "for i in range(4): makes a counter called i. It starts at 0 and goes up by 1 each time round the loop. Fill in the table for the square."
      table: |
        | pass | i | turned so far |
        | 1 | 0 | 90 |
        | 2 | [1] | [180] |
        | 3 | [2] | [270] |
        | 4 | [3] | [360] |
      explain: "i counts 0, 1, 2, 3: four passes, starting from 0. This square never uses i, but it is there, and later programs will use it. After four turns of 90 the turtle has turned 360 degrees, a full turn."
```

Compare the two programs. They draw the same square.

### Count the lines

How much code does each way need as the shape gets more sides?

### Spot the bug

Indented lines belong to the loop. Find the line that should repeat but doesn't.

### Follow the counter

In `for i in range(4):`, the name `i` is a counter. Follow it round the loop.

## Modify

```step
stage: modify
insight: "Change a working program one small step at a time and check each result; the turn angle comes from the shape, not from guessing."
try: { starter: "square.py#modify", height: 420 }
app: true
query: { code: "@square.py#triangle", view: output, autorun: 1 }
clip:
  - wait: 600
  - expect: { selector: "#status", contains: Finished }
  - expect: { selector: "#turtle-state", contains: "heading 0" }
caption: "The expected result: a triangle"
reveal: Show what the triangle should look like
hint:
  - "A square turns the turtle 90 degrees four times. How many times does a triangle turn, and what do all the turns add up to?"
  - "Two numbers change: how many times the loop repeats, and how far the turtle turns each time."
check: { type: reflect, text: "I changed the loop so it draws a triangle." }
```

Change the loop so it draws a triangle instead of a square. Run after each change.

## Make

```step
stage: make
try: { starter: "square.py#make", height: 420 }
app: true
query: { code: "@square.py#sol-stairs", view: output, autorun: 1 }
clip:
  - wait: 600
  - expect: { selector: "#status", contains: Finished }
caption: "The expected result: a staircase with 5 steps"
reveal: Show what the staircase should look like
hint:
  - "Trace one step with your finger. Which moves and turns make one step?"
  - "One step is four lines: up, turn, across, turn back. Put those under a for line."
check: { type: code, text: "Draw a staircase with 5 steps using a loop.", rules: { loops: 1 } }
unlocks: [for-loop]
```

A loop works for any pattern, not only shapes. Find the part that repeats, write it once, and say how many times.

Draw a staircase with 5 steps, like the picture. When it works, change one number to make it 10 steps. Then try a pattern of your own: a zigzag, a row of battlements or a dashed line. Find the part that repeats first.

Next lesson adds variables. Then you put loops and variables to work on a whole program: a street of houses.
