A turtle walks across the screen, leaving a line behind. Your program tells it where to go.

## Predict

```step
stage: predict
code: square.py#square
reveal: true
check:
  type: predict
  q: "What shape will the turtle draw?"
  options: ["a square", "a triangle", "a long line", "a rectangle"]
  actual: "A square: four sides of 100 steps, turning right 90 degrees each time. The turtle finishes back where it started, facing right."
app: true
clip:
  - caption: The turtle starts in the middle, facing right.
  - type:
      into: Python code
      text: "@square.py#square"
  - click: Run
  - expect: { selector: "#status", contains: Finished }
  - expect: { selector: "#turtle-state", contains: "heading 0" }
```

Read the code. What shape will the turtle draw? Where will it finish?

## Run

```step
stage: run
code: square.py#square
try: { starter: "square.py#square", height: 420 }
check: { type: reflect, text: "I can explain what forward(100) and right(90) do to the turtle." }
unlocks: [forward, backward, right, left]
```

Run the program and compare it with your prediction.

## Investigate

```step
stage: investigate
code: square.py#compare
insight: "Repetition has a cost: without a loop the code grows with every side, and a loop does the same work with a number you can change."
app: true
clip:
  - type:
      into: Python code
      text: "@square.py#loop"
  - click: Run
  - expect: { selector: "#status", contains: Finished }
tasks:
  - check:
      type: number
      q: "The square without a loop uses 8 lines of drawing code. A 20-sided shape drawn the same way would use how many lines?"
      answer: 40
      explain: "Each side needs 2 lines (forward and a turn), so 20 sides need 40."
  - check:
      type: number
      q: "Now think about the loop version drawing a 20-sided shape. How many numbers in it change?"
      answer: 2
      explain: "Only range(20) and the turn (360 / 20 = 18 degrees). The loop is the same 3 lines."
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "In the loop version, which part is repeated?"
      options: ["Only the first line", "The two indented lines", "The whole program", "Nothing"]
      answer: 1
      explain: "Indented lines belong to the loop. range(4) says how many times they repeat."
unlocks: [for-loop, square-loop]
```

Compare the two programs. They draw the same square.

### Count the lines

How much code does each way need as the shape gets more sides?

### Count the changes

Now imagine the shape needs to change. Which version is easier to change?

### Read the loop

Look at the loop version one more time. What belongs to it, and what controls how often it runs?

## Modify

```step
stage: modify
insight: "Change a working program one small step at a time and check each result; the turn angle comes from the shape, not from guessing."
try: { starter: "square.py#modify", height: 420 }
app: true
query: { code: "@square.py#triangle", view: output, autorun: 1 }
clip:
  - wait: 600
  - expect: { selector: "#status", contains: Finished }
  - expect: { selector: "#turtle-state", contains: "heading 0" }
caption: "The expected result: a triangle"
reveal: Show what the triangle should look like
tasks:
  - hint:
      - "A square turns the turtle 90 degrees four times. How many times does a triangle turn, and what do all the turns add up to?"
      - "Two numbers change: how many times the loop repeats, and how far the turtle turns each time."
    check: { type: reflect, text: "I changed the loop so it draws a triangle." }
  - hint: "Only one number needs to change."
    check: { type: reflect, text: "I made the triangle's sides twice as long by changing one number." }
  - hint: "pencolor(\"red\") goes before the loop. pensize(5) makes the line thicker."
    check: { type: code, text: "Change the pen colour with pencolor and run it.", rules: { uses: [pencolor] } }
unlocks: [pencolor, pensize, circle]
```

Change the loop in small steps. Run after each change.

### Draw a triangle

Change the loop so it draws a triangle instead of a square.

### Double the sides

Make each side of your triangle twice as long.

### Change the pen

Give your triangle a colour. Try a thicker line too.

## Make

```step
stage: make
try: { starter: "square.py#make", height: 420 }
tasks:
  - check: { type: reflect, text: "I drew the walls of a house." }
  - check: { type: reflect, text: "I drew a roof on top of the walls." }
  - check: { type: reflect, text: "I coloured my house." }
```

Build a house, one part at a time.

### Draw the walls

Draw a square for the walls.

### Add the roof

Add two lines on top that meet in a point for the roof.

### Colour it

Use `pencolor("red")` and other colours to finish your house.

## Extend a row of floor tiles

```step
stage: info
```

Tilers and architects plan floors and rooms with exactly this idea. Where could you use it? Try drawing a row of floor tiles, or a plan of your own bedroom, with loops.

## In the real world

```step
stage: modify
try: { starter: "square.py#use", height: 420 }
```

Tilers and architects plan floors like this: one tile, repeated. Run it, then change the number of tiles, make them bigger, or add a second row.
