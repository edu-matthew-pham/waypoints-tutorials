The micro:bit has **sensors**: parts that measure the world around it, such as how bright it is or how warm. Each sensor gives the program a **number**. You find them in **Input**.

In the simulator, sensors appear as controls when your program uses them: drag the **light** slider (the sun), drag the **temperature** slider (the thermometer), or move the mouse over the micro:bit to **tilt** it.

## Predict

```step
stage: predict
code: lesson.ts#predict
check:
  type: predict
  q: "What will the micro:bit show?"
  options: ["The word light", "A number that changes when the light changes", "0, and nothing else", "The same number over and over, even when the light changes"]
  fault: logic
  misconception: run-once-vs-forever
  actual: "A number that changes with the light. forever reads the light level again each time round, so the number follows the slider."
```

**light level** is a sensor block. It is inside **forever**.

## Run

```step
stage: run
code: lesson.ts#predict
try: { playground: microbit, starter: "lesson.ts#predict" }
check: { type: reflect, text: "I dragged the light slider and watched the number change." }
```

Drag the light slider (the sun on the simulator) up and down. Try the darkest and brightest settings.

## Investigate

```step
stage: investigate
code: lesson.ts#investigate
insight: "A sensor is a number the world keeps changing. Reading it once gives one moment; reading it in forever follows it."
tasks:
  - check:
      type: match
      q: "Match each sensor with what its number means."
      pairs:
        - ["light level", "how bright it is, from 0 (dark) to 255 (bright)"]
        - ["temperature", "how warm it is, in degrees Celsius"]
        - ["acceleration x", "how far it tilts left (below 0) or right (above 0)"]
  - check:
      type: number
      q: "Drag the light slider all the way up. What is the biggest number the light level can be?"
      answer: 255
      explain: "Light level runs from 0 (dark) to 255 (as bright as it can measure)."
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "Sam's program shows the temperature. He drags the temperature slider, but the number never changes. Why?"
      options: ["The temperature sensor is broken", "The block is in on start, so it reads the temperature once", "Temperature only works on a real micro:bit", "He needs a variable"]
      answer: 1
      fault: logic
      misconception: run-once-vs-forever
      explain: "on start runs once, so Sam's program reads the temperature at the very start and never again. In forever, it would read it again each time round."
```

This program keeps each reading in a variable called `reading`, then shows it. The world changes the light; forever reads it again and again.

### What do they measure?

Match each sensor with its number.

### How bright?

Find the top of the light scale.

### Sam's thermometer

Sam's program:

```makecode
basic.showNumber(input.temperature())
```

## Modify

```step
stage: modify
insight: "Any sensor block fits wherever a number fits, and an event decides when it is read."
try: { playground: microbit, starter: "lesson.ts#modify" }
tasks:
  - hint: "temperature is in Input. Drag it into show number, in place of light level."
    check: { type: code, text: "Show the temperature instead of the light level.", rules: { inside: { "basic.forever": ["basic.showNumber(input.temperature())"] } } }
  - hint: ["Use on button A pressed and on button B pressed from Input.", "Put show number inside each one, with a different sensor in each."]
    check: { type: code, text: "A shows the light level, B shows the temperature.", rules: { inside: { "input.onButtonPressed(Button.A": ["input.lightLevel()"], "input.onButtonPressed(Button.B": ["input.temperature()"] } } }
```

### Swap the sensor

Show the temperature instead of the light level. Drag the temperature slider to test it.

### Read on request

Read a sensor only when asked: **A** shows the light level, **B** shows the temperature.

## Mix it up

```step
stage: investigate
code: lesson.ts#review
insight: "change adds to what is there; set throws it away."
check:
  type: trace
  text: "A changes points by 2 and B sets it to 0. Fill in points after each press."
  table: |
    | press | points after |
    | (start) | 0 |
    | A | [2] |
    | A | [4] |
    | B | [0] |
    | A | [2] |
  explain: "Each A adds 2 to whatever points is now. B throws the value away and puts 0 there."
```

A points counter, no sensors in sight.

## Make

```step
stage: make
try: { playground: microbit, starter: "lesson.ts#make" }
hint:
  - "Inside forever: show the temperature, then show the letter C, then pause."
  - "show string is in Basic. Type C into it. 2000 ms is two seconds."
check: { type: code, text: "A thermometer: show the temperature and a C, then wait, again and again.", rules: { inside: { "basic.forever": ["input.temperature()", "basic.showString(", "basic.pause("] } } }
```

Make a **thermometer**. Again and again, it shows the temperature, then the letter **C** (for Celsius), then waits two seconds.

## Change a light meter

```step
stage: modify
try: { playground: microbit, starter: "lesson.ts#meter" }
```

This light meter draws a bar instead of a number: the brighter it is, the more LEDs light up. **plot bar graph** needs the biggest value the sensor can give (255 for light). Change it into a **temperature** meter, where 40 is the biggest value.

```teacher
summary: "Students read light, temperature and tilt as numbers, and see that a sensor read in forever follows the world while one read in on start gives a single moment."
time: 40
timing: "Predict and Run 8 min · Investigate 10 min · Modify 8 min · Mix it up 3 min · Make 7 min · Light meter 4 min"
goals:
  - I can read a sensor and show its number.
  - I can say what the light, temperature and tilt numbers mean.
  - I can make a sensor reading update by itself.
before: |
  A **sensor** gives the program a number that the world keeps changing. In the simulator the controls appear only once a program uses a sensor: the light slider (sun), the temperature slider (thermometer), and tilt by moving the mouse over the micro:bit. The key idea is the forever loop from lesson 2: a sensor read in forever is read again and again; in on start, once.
running:
  - "Predict: ask whether the number will follow the light. The key is that forever reads it again each time. Ask the 'same number over and over' group what forever does each time round."
  - "Run: drag the light slider from dark to bright. The number lags a little because it scrolls."
  - "Investigate: Sam's thermometer is lesson 2's on start mistake again, in a new place. Ask the class which lesson it reminds them of."
  - "Modify: Read on request shows that an event decides when a sensor is read."
  - "Mix it up: a quick trace of set and change from last lesson."
  - "Make: temperature, C, pause: three blocks in forever."
stuck:
  - see: "The number never changes."
    ask: "Is the sensor block in on start or in forever?"
    fix: "Move it into forever (or a button event) so it is read again."
  - see: "The simulator has no slider."
    ask: "Has the program got a sensor block in it, and is it running?"
    fix: "The slider appears only after a sensor block is used. Restart the simulator if needed."
  - see: "The temperature seems too high on a real micro:bit."
    ask: "Where is the sensor?"
    fix: "It is in the processor, which warms up as it works. It reads a little above the room."
stretch: "Show tilt as a number with acceleration x, then make A show tilt left and right and B show tilt forward and back (acceleration y)."
support: "Give students the thermometer's forever block with show number already in it, and ask them to add the C and the pause."
leads: "Next unit: the micro:bit decides what to do using these numbers (if it is dark, light up). Class ideas: measure the brightest and darkest spots in the room with real micro:bits; record the temperature by a window every lesson for a week."
exit:
  q: "Why does reading the temperature in on start not work for a thermometer?"
  a: "on start reads it once, at the start. A thermometer must read it again and again, in forever."
explain: |
  A **sensor** measures something and gives the program a **number**.

  - **light level**: 0 (dark) to 255 (bright)
  - **temperature**: degrees Celsius
  - **acceleration x**: tilt left (below 0) or right (above 0)

  The world keeps changing the number, so read it again in **forever** (or when a button is pressed) to see the new value.
