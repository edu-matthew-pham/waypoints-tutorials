title: How many patterns?
summary: "Each extra bit doubles the number of patterns: n bits make 2ⁿ patterns. One pattern is 0, so the largest number is 2ⁿ − 1: four bits hold 0 to 15, eight bits (a byte) hold 0 to 255. Count one past the largest and the bits overflow back to 0."

In Bits and binary numbers, each card was worth double the card on its right. Now the question is how many different numbers a set of cards can show, and what happens when you run out.

## Predict: the biggest number

```step
stage: predict
insight: "Committing to the largest 4-bit number shows whether students forget that one pattern is 0 (16), confuse it with the number of cards (4), or read 1111 as a base-10 number."
check:
  type: predict
  q: "You have four cards, worth 8, 4, 2 and 1. What is the **biggest** number they can show?"
  options: ["15", "16", "4", "1111"]
  actual: "15. All four cards face up: 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15. There are 16 patterns, but one of them is 0, so the biggest is 15. 1111 is 15 written in binary."
```

## Try: count up

```step
stage: run
insight: "Counting up with + 1 until every card is face up settles the prediction: the count stops at 1111, which is 15."
try: { playground: board, starter: "cards.yml#run", height: 440 }
check: { type: board, text: "Press + 1 to count up until every card is face up. What number is it?", when: "n = 15 and c = 4", explain: "1111 = 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15. Counting from 0, that took 15 presses, so with 0 there are 16 patterns." }
```

Was your prediction right? Watch the 1 card as you count: it flips every time.

## Worked example: count the patterns

```step
stage: investigate
insight: "Counting the patterns as 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 models the new move: n bits give 2ⁿ patterns and the largest is 2ⁿ − 1. Sam counts 16 patterns and then forgets 0, the misconception planted after the method."
tasks:
  - check:
      type: answer
      q: "What is the biggest number **five** bits can show?"
      answer: "31"
      feedback:
        - ["32", "Five bits make 32 patterns, but one of them is 0. So the numbers go from 0 to 31."]
        - ["5", "5 is how many bits. Add all the places: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1."]
        - ["11111", "That is the pattern. What number is it?"]
      explain: "11111 = 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 31. Five bits make 2⁵ = 32 patterns: 0 to 31."
  - check:
      type: bug
      code: "working.txt#sam"
      text: "Sam works out how many numbers 4 bits can show. Click the line where the working first goes wrong."
      answer: 4
      fault: logic
      misconception: binary-max-forgets-zero
      explain: "Line 4: the 16 patterns are 0000 to 1111, so the numbers are 0 to 15. Sam left out 0 (all cards face down)."
  - check:
      type: answer
      q: "How many different patterns can **three** bits make?"
      answer: "8"
      feedback:
        - ["7", "7 is the biggest number (111). Count 0 as a pattern too: 0 to 7 is 8 patterns."]
        - ["6", "Each bit has 2 choices, so multiply: 2 × 2 × 2."]
        - ["3", "3 is how many bits. Each one doubles the patterns."]
      explain: "2 × 2 × 2 = 8 patterns: 000, 001, 010, 011, 100, 101, 110, 111. That is 0 to 7."
```

### Count the patterns

```worked
1111 = 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15 :: All cards face up is the biggest number.
0000 = 0 :: All cards face down is the smallest.
2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 2 = 2^4 = 16 :: Each card has 2 choices, so each card doubles the patterns.
0 \text{ to } 15 :: 16 patterns, and one of them is 0, so the biggest is 15.
2^4 - 1 = 15 :: With $n$ bits: $2^n$ patterns, and the biggest number is $2^n - 1$.
```

Now try five bits.

### Find the mistake

### Three bits

## Vary: one change at a time

```step
stage: modify
insight: "Each task changes one thing: one more past the largest (overflow), one more card (patterns double), another card, then a byte, then the edge case of choosing how many bits a number needs."
try: { playground: board, starter: "cards.yml#modify", height: 460 }
tasks:
  - check: { type: board, text: "The board shows 1111, which is 15. Press + 1 once. What happens to the cards?", when: "o = 1", explain: "Every card went face down and the count went back to 0. Four bits cannot show 16, so the count overflows." }
  - check: { type: board, text: "Press Add a card. What is the new card worth? Make the biggest number five cards can show.", when: "b = 5 and n = 31", explain: "The new card is worth 16, double the 8. All five up: 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 31." }
  - check: { type: board, text: "Add one more card and make the biggest number six cards can show.", when: "b = 6 and n = 63", explain: "The new card is worth 32. 32 + 31 = 63, which is 2⁶ − 1." }
  - check:
      type: answer
      q: "Eight bits are called a **byte**. What is the biggest number a byte can hold?"
      answer: "255"
      feedback:
        - ["256", "A byte makes 2⁸ = 256 patterns, but one of them is 0."]
        - ["128", "128 is the leftmost card. Add all eight: 128 + 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1."]
        - ["8", "8 is how many bits. Each one doubles the patterns."]
      explain: "2⁸ = 256 patterns, so a byte holds 0 to 255."
  - check:
      type: answer
      q: "What is the **fewest** bits that can hold the number 100?"
      answer: "7"
      feedback:
        - ["6", "Six bits stop at 63. One more bit doubles that: seven bits reach 127."]
        - ["8", "Eight bits work, but fewer will do: seven bits reach 127."]
        - ["100", "Count bits, not numbers: each bit doubles the biggest number."]
      explain: "Six bits hold 0 to 63, seven bits hold 0 to 127. 100 needs seven bits."
```

### One past the biggest

### Add a card

### Six cards

### A byte

### How many bits?

Keep doubling: 1, 3, 7, 15, 31, 63, 127. Which is the first that reaches 100?

## Practise: patterns and limits

```step
stage: practise
insight: "Patterns and largest numbers for other bit counts, overflow in a real context, why colour values stop at 255, and a review of reading binary from lesson 1."
tasks:
  - check:
      type: answer
      q: "How many different patterns can **ten** bits make?"
      answer: "1024"
      feedback:
        - ["1023", "1023 is the biggest number. Count 0 too: the patterns are 0 to 1023."]
        - ["20", "Multiply, don't add: each bit doubles the patterns. $2^{10}$."]
        - ["100", "That is 10 × 10. Each bit has 2 choices: $2^{10}$."]
      explain: "$2^{10} = 1024$ patterns, so ten bits hold 0 to 1023."
  - check:

      q: "An old game stores the score in one byte. The score is 255 and the player scores 1 more point. What does the score show?"
      options: ["0", "256", "255", "An error message"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "256 needs a ninth bit. The byte has only eight.", "The score did change: every bit flipped.", "The computer just adds 1; the bits run out and flip back."]
      explain: "255 is 11111111. Adding 1 overflows: every bit flips to 0 and the score shows 0. Real games have had bugs like this."
  - check:
      type: answer
      q: "In many programs, the amount of red in a colour goes from 0 to 255. How many bits store it?"
      answer: "8"
      feedback:
        - ["255", "255 is the biggest value. How many bits make 0 to 255?"]
        - ["256", "There are 256 values. Which power of 2 is 256?"]
      explain: "0 to 255 is 256 values, and $2^8 = 256$. So each colour amount is one byte."
  - check:

      q: "What is the biggest number **three** bits can show?"

      feedback:

        - ["111", "That is the pattern. What number is it?"]
      explain: "111 = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7."
  - check:

      q: "Review: what number is **10101** in binary?"
      answer: "21"
      feedback:
        - ["3", "Do not count the 1s. Add their places: 16, 4 and 1."]
        - ["10101", "That reads it as a base-10 number. The places are 16, 8, 4, 2, 1."]
      explain: "10101 = 16 + 4 + 1 = 21."
```

### Ten bits

### Score overflow

### Colour values

### Three bits

### Review: read binary

## Make: enough bits

```step
stage: make
insight: "Choosing the fewest cards for a given range reverses the process: students start from the largest number needed and work out the bits, then check it on the board."
try: { playground: board, starter: "cards.yml#make", height: 460 }
hint: ["How big a number must the cards show? Add cards until they can show it.", "Five cards stop at 31. Is that enough for 39?", "Six cards: 32 + 4 + 2 + 1."]
check: { type: board, text: "A school gives each student in a group an ID number from 0 to 39. Use the fewest cards that can show 39, then set them to 39.", when: "b = 6 and n = 39", explain: "Five cards stop at 31, so you need six (0 to 63). 39 = 32 + 4 + 2 + 1, so 100111." }
```

Then: how many more students could join before you need a seventh card?
