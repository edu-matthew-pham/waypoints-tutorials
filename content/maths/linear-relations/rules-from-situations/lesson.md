title: Rules from real situations
summary: Many real costs and amounts are a starting amount plus a rate. The starting amount is c and the rate is m, so the rule is y = mx + c.

So far the rules had $x$ and $y$. Real situations have their own letters: $T$ for a total cost, $d$ for a distance, $h$ for hours. The graph works the same way: $m$ is still how much the line goes up for each step right, and $c$ is still where it starts.

## Predict: a taxi fare

```step
stage: predict
insight: "Committing to a rule before fitting the line shows whether students can tell the one-off amount from the rate in words."
check:
  type: predict
  q: "A taxi costs 4 dollars to get in, plus 2 dollars for each km. Which rule gives the fare $T$ for a trip of $d$ km?"
  options: ["$T = 2d + 4$", "$T = 4d + 2$", "$T = 6d$", "$T = 2d$"]
  actual: "T = 2d + 4. The 4 dollars is paid once, before you travel: it is where the line starts (c). The 2 dollars is paid for each km: it is the rate (m)."
```

Think about a trip of 0 km, then 1 km, then 2 km. What does each one cost?

## Run: fit the fares

```step
stage: run
insight: "Fitting a line through real fares makes c and m mean something: c is the fare for 0 km, m is the extra for each km."
try: { playground: board, starter: "graph.yml#run", height: 680 }
check: { type: board, text: "Set $m$ and $c$ so the line goes through all three fares.", when: "P on y = mx + c and Q on y = mx + c and R on y = mx + c" }
```

The points are three real fares: 6 dollars for 1 km, 10 dollars for 3 km and 14 dollars for 5 km. Set $m$ and $c$ so the line passes through all three. Was your rule right?

## Investigate: from words to a rule

```step
stage: investigate
insight: "In words, the starting amount is the value when nothing has happened yet (c); the rate is 'per', 'each' or 'every' (m)."
tasks:
  - picture: { ref: graph.yml#explain-pic, caption: "The taxi: starts at 4 (the fee), up 2 for each km (the rate)." }
    check:
      type: answer
      q: "A gym charges a 30 dollar joining fee and 15 dollars a week. Write a rule for the total cost $T$ after $w$ weeks."
      answer: "15w + 30"
      feedback:
        - ["30w + 15", "That charges 30 each week. Which amount is paid only once, at the start?"]
        - ["15w", "You have the weekly rate. What about the joining fee?"]
        - ["45w", "The joining fee is paid once, not every week. Keep it separate."]
      explain: "T = 15w + 30: 30 dollars once (c), then 15 dollars for each week (m)."
  - check:
      type: bug
      code: "working.txt#zoe"
      text: "Zoe writes a rule for a taxi fare. Click the line where her reasoning goes wrong."
      answer: 2
      fault: logic
      misconception: m-c-swap
      explain: "Line 2: m is the rate, the amount for each km, which is 3. It does not matter which number comes first in the question. The rule is T = 3d + 5."
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "A phone plan costs $T = 5g + 20$ dollars a month for $g$ GB of data. What does the 5 mean?"
      options: ["5 dollars for each GB used", "5 GB of data are included", "The monthly fee is 5 dollars"]
      answer: 0
      explain: "5 is m, the rate: each extra GB adds 5 dollars. The 20 is c, the fee you pay even with no data."
```

### A phone plan

Here is how to turn words into a rule.

```worked
\text{Fee } 20, \text{ then } 5 \text{ per GB} :: A phone plan costs 20 dollars a month, plus 5 dollars for each GB used. Find a rule for the cost $T$.
g = 0: \; T = 20 :: With no data used, you still pay the fee. That is the value when $g$ is 0.
c = 20 :: The starting amount is $c$.
m = 5 :: Each extra GB adds 5 dollars. "Per", "each" or "every" signals the rate, $m$.
T = 5g + 20 :: Put them together.
g = 3: \; T = 5(3) + 20 = 35 :: Check with a value you can work out in words: 3 GB costs 20 + 15 = 35 dollars.
```

### Find the mistake

Read Zoe's working one line at a time. How did she decide which number is $m$?

### What the numbers mean

Read the rule back into words.

## Modify: new situations

```step
stage: modify
insight: "One change at a time: no starting amount (c = 0), an amount that goes down (negative m), a rate that is not whole, and only two points with no words."
try: { playground: board, starter: "graph.yml#no-fee", height: 640 }
tasks:
  - starter: "graph.yml#no-fee"
    hint: "What does hiring the bike for 0 hours cost?"
    check: { type: board, text: "Bike hire: 6 dollars for 1 hour, 24 dollars for 4 hours. Set $m$ and $c$ so the line goes through both.", when: "P on y = mx + c and Q on y = mx + c", explain: "T = 6h: 6 dollars per hour and no fee, so c = 0 and the line starts at (0, 0)." }
  - starter: "graph.yml#down"
    hint: ["The battery goes from 80% to 50% in 3 hours. How much each hour?", "It goes down, so m is negative. Then work back to 0 hours for c."]
    check: { type: board, text: "A phone battery: 80% after 2 hours, 50% after 5 hours. Fit the line.", when: "P on y = mx + c and Q on y = mx + c", explain: "B = −10h + 100: it starts full (c = 100) and goes down 10% each hour (m = −10)." }
  - starter: "graph.yml#half"
    hint: "From 2 pages to 6 pages the cost goes up 2 dollars. How much per page?"
    check: { type: board, text: "Printing: 3 dollars for 2 pages, 5 dollars for 6 pages. Fit the line.", when: "P on y = mx + c and Q on y = mx + c", explain: "T = 0.5n + 2: a 2 dollar fee and 50 cents a page." }
  - starter: "graph.yml#points-only"
    hint: ["From 2 km to 4 km the fare goes up 6. How much per km?", "Work back from 2 km to 0 km to find the fee."]
    check: { type: board, text: "Two fares from a table: 11 dollars for 2 km and 17 dollars for 4 km. Find the rule.", when: "P on y = mx + c and Q on y = mx + c", explain: "T = 3d + 5: up 6 over 2 km is 3 per km, and 11 − 2 × 3 = 5 to get in." }
```

### No starting amount

Each task gives some real values as points. Set $m$ and $c$ so the line goes through them all.

### Going down

A phone battery runs down at the same rate each hour.

### Less than a dollar

Printing costs a fee plus a little for each page.

### Only the numbers

No words this time: just two fares. Work out the rate first.

## Practise: rules and meanings

```step
stage: practise
insight: "Writing a rule, reading its numbers in words and using it for a value are one skill; the review keeps solving with graphs fresh."
tasks:
  - check:
      type: answer
      q: "Concert tickets cost 12 dollars each, plus a 6 dollar booking fee for the order. Write a rule for the total $T$ for $n$ tickets."
      answer: "12n + 6"
      feedback:
        - ["6n + 12", "Which amount is paid once for the whole order? That one is c."]
        - ["18n", "The booking fee is paid once, not for every ticket."]
      explain: "T = 12n + 6: 12 dollars for each ticket (m) and 6 dollars once (c)."
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "A plumber charges $T = 80h + 60$ dollars for a job of $h$ hours. What does the 60 mean?"
      options: ["A 60 dollar call-out fee, paid once", "60 dollars for each hour", "The cost of a 60-hour job"]
      answer: 0
      explain: "60 is c: what you pay even for 0 hours, the call-out fee. 80 is the hourly rate."
  - check:
      type: answer
      q: "Using $T = 80h + 60$, what does a 3-hour job cost, in dollars?"
      answer: "300"
      feedback:
        - ["240", "That is the hours only (80 × 3). Add the call-out fee."]
        - ["420", "Check: 80 × 3 = 240, not 360."]
      explain: "80 × 3 + 60 = 240 + 60 = 300 dollars."
  - check:
      type: answer
      q: "Review: $y = 2x + 1$ and $y = 7$ meet at $(3, 7)$. Solve $2x + 1 = 7$."
      answer: "3"
      feedback:
        - ["7", "7 is the y of the meeting point. The solution is its x."]
      explain: "x = 3. Check: 2 × 3 + 1 = 7."
```

### Tickets

### What the 60 means

### Using the rule

### Review

## Make: your own situation

```step
stage: make
insight: "Choosing a starting amount and a rate for a situation of their own reverses the lesson: from the rule back to words."
try: { playground: board, starter: "graph.yml#make", height: 640 }
hint: ["Pick a starting amount with c and a rate with m.", "Work out the total for 4 units: 4 lots of m, plus c. Drag P there."]
check: { type: board, text: "Choose your own starting amount and rate (both more than 0). Then drag $P$ to the total for 4 units.", when: "P on y = mx + c and x(P) = 4 and m > 0 and c > 0", explain: "P is the total for 4 units: 4 lots of your rate, plus your starting amount." }
```

Invent a situation that is a starting amount plus a rate: a club with a joining fee and a weekly cost, a game with a starting score and points per level. Set $c$ and $m$, then drag $P$ to the total for 4 units.

Stretch: tell a partner your situation in words. Can they write your rule?
