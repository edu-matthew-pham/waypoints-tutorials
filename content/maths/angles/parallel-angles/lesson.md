In Angles at parallel lines you named the pairs: corresponding, alternate and co-interior. Now the useful part: when the lines are parallel, each pair has a rule, so one angle tells you the rest.

You also learn to give a **reason** for each angle you find, such as "alternate angles are equal".

## Predict: a co-interior pair

```step
stage: predict
insight: "Committing to e when c = 65° tests whether they apply 'equal' to every pair, the most common slip with co-interior angles."
check:
  type: predict
  q: "Two parallel lines are crossed by a transversal. $c = 65^\\circ$, and $e$ is co-interior with $c$. What is $e$?"
  options:
    - "$115^\\circ$"
    - "$65^\\circ$"
    - "$25^\\circ$"
    - "$295^\\circ$"
  actual: "115°. Co-interior angles are not equal: they add to 180°, so e = 180° − 65° = 115°."
```

Corresponding and alternate angles are equal. Is a co-interior pair the same?

## Run: test it

```step
stage: run
insight: "Setting c to 65° and picking c and e shows the co-interior pair adding to 180°, not equal; turning the line shows it holds for every angle."
try: { playground: board, starter: "lines.yml#run", height: 560 }
check: { type: board, text: "Turn the crossing line until $c = 65^\\circ$, then pick $c$ and $e$. Was your prediction right?", when: "c = 65 and r = 3" }
```

Then turn the crossing line again. Do $c$ and $e$ always add to $180^\circ$?

## Investigate: from one angle to all eight

```step
stage: investigate
insight: "Each angle follows from a known one by a named rule: corresponding or alternate (equal), co-interior or a straight line (add to 180°), vertically opposite (equal). Leo's mistake makes co-interior angles equal."
tasks:
  - picture: { ref: lines.yml#given-b, caption: "Two parallel lines. $b = 72^\\circ$." }
    check:
      type: answer
      q: "Find $f$."
      answer: "72"
      feedback:
        - ["108", "b and f are in the same place at each crossing: corresponding, so equal."]
      explain: "b and f are corresponding angles, so f = 72°."
  - check:
      type: bug
      code: "working.txt#leo"
      text: "Leo finds $f$ when $d = 110^\\circ$. Click the line where his working goes wrong."
      answer: 4
      fault: logic
      misconception: co-interior-equal
      explain: "Line 4: co-interior angles add to 180°, so f = 180° − 110° = 70°. Only corresponding and alternate angles are equal."
  - picture: { ref: lines.yml#given-d, caption: "Two parallel lines. $d = 110^\\circ$." }
    check:
      type: answer
      q: "Find $f$ correctly."
      answer: "70"
      feedback:
        - ["110", "d and f are co-interior: they add to 180°."]
      explain: "Co-interior angles add to 180°: f = 180° − 110° = 70°."
```

### Equal pairs

Here is how one angle gives all eight, with a reason for each.

```worked
b = 70^\circ :: Given.
c = 70^\circ :: Vertically opposite $b$: equal.
a = 110^\circ :: On a straight line with $b$: $180 - 70$.
f = 70^\circ :: Corresponding to $b$: equal.
e = 110^\circ :: Co-interior with $c$: they add to $180^\circ$.
g = 70^\circ,\; h = 110^\circ :: Corresponding to $c$ and to $d$ (or vertically opposite $f$ and $e$).
```

Then find $f$ in the picture.

### Find the mistake

Read Leo's working one line at a time. Which rule did he use?

### Co-interior

## Modify: one change at a time

```step
stage: modify
insight: "One change at a time: alternate, co-interior from the lower crossing, two steps, the board to check a chain, then the edge case where the lines are not parallel."
try: { playground: board, starter: "lines.yml#make", height: 560 }
tasks:
  - picture: { ref: lines.yml#given-c, caption: "Two parallel lines. $c = 50^\\circ$." }
    check:
      type: answer
      q: "Alternate: find $f$."
      answer: "50"
      feedback:
        - ["130", "c and f are alternate: equal."]
      explain: "Alternate angles are equal: f = 50°."
  - picture: { ref: lines.yml#given-e, caption: "Two parallel lines. $e = 125^\\circ$." }
    check:
      type: answer
      q: "Co-interior, starting at the bottom: find $c$."
      answer: "55"
      feedback:
        - ["125", "c and e are co-interior: they add to 180°."]
      explain: "Co-interior angles add to 180°: c = 180° − 125° = 55°."
  - picture: { ref: lines.yml#given-a, caption: "Two parallel lines. $a = 140^\\circ$." }
    hint: ["a and e are corresponding.", "Then e and g are on a straight line."]
    check:
      type: answer
      q: "Two steps: find $g$."
      answer: "40"
      feedback:
        - ["140", "g is not in the same place as a. Find e first, then use a straight line."]
      explain: "e = 140° (corresponding to a), then g = 180° − 140° = 40° (a straight line). Or: b = 40° (a straight line), f = 40° (corresponding), g = 40° (vertically opposite)."
  - starter: "lines.yml#make"
    hint: ["h = 180° − t, so t = 50°.", "b is corresponding to f, and f is on a straight line with h."]
    check: { type: board, text: "Turn the crossing line until $h = 130^\\circ$. Work out $b$ first, then pick $h$ and $b$ to check.", when: "h = 130 and u = 2 and v = 8", explain: "f = 50° (a straight line with h), so b = 50° (corresponding)." }
  - picture: { ref: lines.yml#tilt-pic, caption: "The lower line is tilted: the lines are not parallel. $c = 60^\\circ$." }
    check:
      type: question
      q: "Edge case: can you use \"alternate angles are equal\" to find $f$ here?"
      options: ["No: the lines are not parallel", "Yes: c and f are alternate", "Yes, but only for co-interior angles"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "They are in alternate places, but the rule needs parallel lines. On the board, f was 45°.", "No pair rule works without parallel lines."]
      explain: "The rules hold only for parallel lines. Look for the arrow marks (>>) before you use them."
```

### Alternate

Each task changes one thing. Give the reason as well as the size.

### Co-interior from below

### Two steps

### Check a chain

### Not parallel

## Practise: angle and reason

```step
stage: practise
insight: "Finding angles with each rule and naming the reason, mixed, with the co-interior slip planted again; the review keeps the pair names fresh."
tasks:
  - picture: { ref: lines.yml#given-g, caption: "Two parallel lines. $g = 80^\\circ$." }
    check:
      type: answer
      q: "Find $c$."
      answer: "80"
      feedback:
        - ["100", "c and g are in the same place at each crossing: corresponding, so equal."]
      explain: "Corresponding angles are equal: c = 80°."
  - picture: { ref: lines.yml#given-f, caption: "Two parallel lines. $f = 62^\\circ$." }
    check:
      type: answer
      q: "Find $d$."
      answer: "118"
      feedback:
        - ["62", "d and f are co-interior: they add to 180°."]
      explain: "Co-interior angles add to 180°: d = 180° − 62° = 118°."
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "$e = 120^\\circ$ and $c = 60^\\circ$. Which reason links them?"
      options: ["Co-interior angles add to 180°", "Alternate angles are equal", "Corresponding angles are equal"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "They are not equal.", "They are not equal."]
      explain: "c and e are between the lines on the same side, and 60° + 120° = 180°."
  - picture: { ref: lines.yml#letters, caption: "The angles $a$ to $h$." }
    check:
      type: question
      q: "Review: which pair is alternate?"
      options: ["$d$ and $e$", "$d$ and $f$", "$d$ and $h$", "$a$ and $d$"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "Same side of the crossing line: co-interior.", "Same place at each crossing: corresponding.", "One crossing: vertically opposite."]
      explain: "d and e: between the lines, on opposite sides."
```

### Corresponding

### Co-interior

### The reason

### Review: names

## Make: equal co-interior angles

```step
stage: make
insight: "Making a co-interior pair equal reverses the rule: two angles that add to 180° are equal only when both are 90°."
try: { playground: board, starter: "lines.yml#make", height: 560 }
hint: ["c and e add to 180°. If they are equal, what is each?", "Turn until c = 90°."]
check: { type: board, text: "Turn the crossing line so that the co-interior angles $c$ and $e$ are equal.", when: "c = e", explain: "They add to 180°, so equal means 90° each: the crossing line is perpendicular to the parallel lines." }
```

Then: can alternate angles ever add to $180^\circ$? When?
