You know the angle sums: a triangle's angles add to $180^\circ$, and a polygon with $n$ sides has $(n - 2) \times 180^\circ$. With straight-line angles and the parallel-line rules, you can find angles you cannot measure.

As in Reasoning with angles, each step needs a reason. Write your working your own way; the checker marks your answer and a reason at the key step, then shows a model to compare.

## Predict: the outside angle

```step
stage: predict
insight: "Committing to the exterior angle before working it out shows whether they see the two-step chain (angle sum, then straight line), and sets up x = a + b."
check:
  type: predict
  q: "A triangle has $a = 50^\\circ$ and $b = 60^\\circ$. The side through $C$ is extended past $C$, making an outside angle $x$ with the third side. What is $x$?"
  options:
    - "$110^\\circ$"
    - "$70^\\circ$"
    - "$130^\\circ$"
    - "$120^\\circ$"
  actual: "110°. c = 180° − 50° − 60° = 70° (angles in a triangle), then x = 180° − 70° = 110° (a straight line). Notice: 110° = 50° + 60°."
```

Two steps: which angle can you find first?

## Run: drag the triangle

```step
stage: run
insight: "Dragging the triangle while watching x shows the exterior angle always equals the two opposite angles added: the two-step chain gives a shortcut."
try: { playground: board, starter: "shapes.yml#run", height: 600 }
check: { type: board, text: "Drag the corners (or use Move) until $x$ is more than $120^\\circ$. Each time, compare $x$ with $a + b$.", when: "x > 120" }
```

Was your prediction right? Is $x$ always $a + b$? Why must it be?

## Investigate: angle sums in steps

```

### Triangle, then a straight line

Here is the routine: know, choose the rule, say why.

```worked
a = 59^\circ,\; b = 45^\circ :: Know: the given angles.
c = 180^\circ - 59^\circ - 45^\circ = 76^\circ :: Choose: $a$, $b$, $c$ are a triangle's angles. Why: angles in a triangle add to $180^\circ$.
x = 180^\circ - 76^\circ = 104^\circ :: Choose: $c$ and $x$ sit on one straight line. Why: angles on a straight line add to $180^\circ$.
x = 59^\circ + 45^\circ :: A shortcut you can now explain: an exterior angle equals the sum of the two interior opposite angles.
```

Now find $x$ yourself, your own way.

### Find the mistake

Read Zoe's working. Which line uses the wrong fact?

### Triangle

### Quadrilateral

### Exterior angle backwards

### Review: parallel lines

## Make: a given exterior angle

```step
stage: make
insight: "Making a triangle with a given exterior angle reverses the reasoning: x = 135° needs c = 45°, from a + b = 135°."
try: { playground: board, starter: "shapes.yml#make", height: 600 }
hint: ["x = 135° means c = 45°.", "A right angle at A and equal legs give 45° at C: try A (1, 1), B (7, 1), C (1, 7)."]
check: { type: board, text: "Move the corners so that the exterior angle $x$ is $135^\\circ$.", when: "x = 135", explain: "c = 45°, so a + b = 135°: for example a = 90° and b = 45°." }
```

First work out what $c$ must be. Then find a triangle that has it.

Stretch: design an angle puzzle for a partner with two unknown angles, and write the model reasons.
