title: How do we know the universe is expanding?
summary: "Light from distant galaxies is redshifted: shifted to longer wavelengths, so they are moving away. Farther galaxies move away faster (Hubble's law), exactly what an expanding universe predicts, from any galaxy. Run backwards, everything was once together: evidence for the big bang."

The big bang model predicts an expanding universe. This lesson tests that prediction.

## Engage: the centre?

```step
stage: predict
insight: "Students who picture galaxies flying away from a centre conclude we are at the centre; changing the home galaxy in the board removes it."
check:
  type: predict
  q: "Almost every galaxy is moving away from the Milky Way. What do you predict that means?"
  options: ["We are at the centre of the universe", "Space is expanding, and every galaxy would see the others moving away", "Galaxies are scared of us", "The Milky Way is shrinking"]
  actual: "Space is expanding, so from any galaxy, the others move away. There is no centre: the same pattern appears wherever you live."
```

## Explore: stretch space

```step
stage: run
insight: "Stretching space and measuring several galaxies shows speed growing with distance, the pattern Hubble found."
try: { playground: board, starter: "boards.yml#expand", height: 760 }
tasks:
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "First, reading light. A galaxy's spectrum runs from violet (short wavelengths) to red (long wavelengths). Its dark hydrogen lines sit further towards the red end than the same lines measured in a lab. What has happened to its light?"
      options: ["It has been stretched to longer wavelengths", "It has been squashed to shorter wavelengths", "The whole galaxy has turned red", "It has become hotter"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "Shorter wavelengths are at the violet end. Which way did the lines move?", "The colours across the spectrum are the same; only the dark lines have moved.", "Temperature changes the overall glow, not where hydrogen's lines sit."]
      explain: "Hydrogen always leaves its dark lines at the same wavelengths. Lines moved towards the red mean longer wavelengths: the light has been stretched. That is a redshift."
  - check: { type: board, text: "Let space expand, then measure at least three galaxies at different distances.", when: "e = 1 and q = 1" }
```

### Reading a spectrum

Spread a galaxy's light out and you get a **spectrum**, a rainbow from violet (short wavelengths) to red (long wavelengths). Hydrogen gas leaves dark lines in it at fixed wavelengths, a fingerprint you can compare with the same lines measured in a lab.

### Stretch space

Press **Let space expand**. Then click galaxies near and far: compare their distances, speeds and light.

## Explain: redshift and Hubble's law

```step
stage: investigate
insight: "Linking redshift to motion away, and the distance–speed pattern to expansion, is the evidence chain."
tasks:
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "What does a redshift in a galaxy's light tell us?"
      options: ["The galaxy is moving away from us: its light is stretched to longer, redder wavelengths", "The galaxy is red", "The galaxy is moving towards us", "The galaxy is hot"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "It's the dark lines' positions that shift, not the galaxy's colour.", "That would be a blueshift.", "Temperature changes the overall colour, not where the lines sit."]
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "On your graph, how does speed depend on distance?"
      options: ["Farther galaxies move away faster, in proportion: double the distance, double the speed", "All galaxies move at the same speed", "Nearer galaxies move faster", "There's no pattern"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "Look at the points: they climb.", "The points go the other way.", "The points lie close to a straight line through the origin."]
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "How does an expanding universe support the big bang theory?"
      options: ["Run the expansion backwards and all galaxies were once together, in a hot, dense state", "It proves the universe is shrinking", "It shows the universe has a centre", "It doesn't"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "The redshifts say the opposite.", "Expansion looks the same from everywhere.", "It's one of the main lines of evidence."]
  - check: { type: reflect, text: "I can explain redshift as evidence that galaxies are moving away, and connect Hubble's observations to an expanding universe and the big bang." }
```

### Redshift

### The pattern

### Back in time

### In your own words

In your book: sketch your distance–speed graph and write two sentences linking it to the big bang.

## Elaborate: no centre

```step
stage: modify
tier: typical
insight: "Seeing the same pattern from two home galaxies shows expansion has no centre."
try: { playground: board, starter: "boards.yml#expand", height: 760 }
tasks:
  - check: { type: board, text: "Live in two different galaxies and let space expand from each.", when: "h >= 2 and e = 1" }
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "From the second home galaxy, what did the other galaxies do?"
      options: ["They all moved away, farther ones faster: the same pattern as before", "They moved towards it", "Only some moved", "Nothing"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "Watch the orange lines from the new home.", "Not in an expanding universe.", "Every galaxy moved."]
```

### Two homes

### Same pattern

## Elaborate: a blueshift

```step
stage: modify
tier: wider
insight: "A local exception shows the difference between a galaxy's own motion and the expansion of space."
check:
  type: question
  q: "The Andromeda galaxy, our nearest big neighbour, is blueshifted. Does this disprove the expanding universe?"
  options: ["No: nearby galaxies' own motions under gravity can beat the expansion; over large distances, the redshift pattern is clear", "Yes: the universe is shrinking", "Yes: Hubble was wrong", "It means Andromeda is red"]
  answer: 0
  feedback: [null, "One nearby galaxy doesn't change the pattern of millions.", "The pattern holds for distant galaxies.", "Blueshift means moving towards us."]
```

## Evaluate: look back

```step
stage: info
check: { type: reflect, text: "I compared my first answer about the centre of the universe with what I now know." }
```

Write one sentence: "At first I thought… Now I think… because…"

**Revision summary**

- **Redshift:** light from distant galaxies is shifted to longer wavelengths: they are moving **away**.
- **Hubble's law:** farther galaxies move away **faster**, in proportion to distance.
- This is what an **expanding universe** looks like from any galaxy (no centre). Run backwards, everything was once together: evidence for the **big bang**.
