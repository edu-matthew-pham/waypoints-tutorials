title: Moving or stored?
introduces: [energy-stores]
summary: "Energy comes in two big families. Kinetic energy is energy of activity: movement, heat, sound, light and electricity. Potential energy is stored, ready to be released: chemical (food, fuel, batteries), gravitational (things up high) and elastic (things stretched or squashed). Energy can change from one to the other and back."

In earlier years you met sound, heat, light and electricity one at a time. This lesson sorts them into two families.

## Engage: the book on the shelf

```step
stage: predict
insight: "Students link energy only to movement; a still book with stored energy is the case that needs the idea of potential energy."
check:
  type: predict
  q: "A heavy book sits still on a high shelf. Does it have any energy?"
  options: ["Yes: stored energy, because it is high up and could fall", "No: it isn't moving", "Only if someone pushes it", "No: energy is only in living things"]
  actual: "Yes. It has gravitational potential energy, stored because it is high up. Knock it off and that stored energy becomes kinetic energy as it falls."
```

## Explore: ride the coaster

```step
stage: run
insight: "Watching two bars trade places as the car goes down and up makes 'stored' and 'moving' energy two forms of one thing."
try: { playground: board, starter: "boards.yml#coaster", height: 640 }
check: { type: board, text: "Run the coaster to the end. Watch the blue (potential) and orange (kinetic) bars.", when: "r >= 1" }
```

Press **Play**. Where is the car when the orange bar is tallest? When is the blue bar tallest?

## Explain: two families

```step
stage: investigate
insight: "Sorting familiar energy forms into kinetic and potential, then naming what decides how much is stored, organises years of separate ideas into one framework."
tasks:
  - check:
      type: sort
      q: "Kinetic (active) or potential (stored)?"
      options: ["Kinetic", "Potential"]
      items:
        - ["A rolling ball", "Kinetic"]
        - ["The heat from a heater", "Kinetic", "Heat is the movement of particles."]
        - ["Music from a speaker", "Kinetic", "Sound is vibrating air."]
        - ["Light from a torch", "Kinetic"]
        - ["Food in your lunchbox", "Potential", "Stored as chemical energy, released when you digest it."]
        - ["A stretched rubber band", "Potential"]
        - ["A charged battery", "Potential"]
        - ["A diver on a high board", "Potential"]
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "On the coaster, where is the kinetic energy greatest?"
      options: ["At the bottom of the deepest dip, where the car is fastest", "At the top of the first hill", "It stays the same everywhere"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "At the top the car is slow: most of its energy is potential.", "The bars change all the time; only the total stays the same."]
      explain: "Lowest point, least potential energy, so the most kinetic energy: the car is fastest there."
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "What decides how much gravitational potential energy something has?"
      options: ["How heavy it is and how high it is", "How fast it is moving", "What colour it is"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "Speed decides kinetic energy.", "Colour has nothing to do with it."]
      explain: "Heavier and higher means more stored. Likewise, stretching a spring further stores more elastic energy, and different foods store different amounts of chemical energy."
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "What do all kinds of kinetic energy have in common, and how is potential energy different?"
      options: ["Kinetic energy is active now (something moving, vibrating or flowing); potential energy is stored, ready to be released", "Kinetic energy is only in moving objects; heat, light and sound aren't kinetic", "Potential energy is energy that might exist one day but doesn't yet", "Kinetic energy is useful; potential energy is wasted"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "Heat is particles moving, sound is vibrating air and electricity is moving charge: all active, so all kinetic.", "Potential energy is really there now, just stored: a stretched rubber band has it before you let go.", "Both can be useful. The difference is whether the energy is active now or stored."]
      explain: "Ask 'is it active now, or stored?' Active (moving, vibrating, flowing) is kinetic; stored and ready to be released is potential."
  - check: { type: reflect, text: "I can sort energy into kinetic and potential, with examples of each." }
```

### Sort them

### Fastest point

### How much is stored

### Active or stored

### In your own words

In your book: draw two columns, Kinetic and Potential, with at least three examples in each. Then draw the coaster with arrows showing where potential energy becomes kinetic.

## Elaborate: a higher hill

```step
stage: modify
tier: typical
insight: "Starting higher shows stored energy depends on height, and that a bigger store means more kinetic energy later."
try: { playground: board, starter: "boards.yml#higher", height: 640 }
tasks:
  - check: { type: board, text: "This coaster starts at 45 m instead of 30 m. Run it to the end.", when: "r >= 1" }
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "Compared with the 30 m start, what is different?"
      options: ["More total energy, so the car goes faster at the bottom", "The same total energy", "Less kinetic energy at the bottom"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "Higher means more stored energy to start with.", "More stored at the start means more to turn into movement."]
      explain: "More height, more gravitational potential energy, more kinetic energy when it comes down."
```

### Start higher

### What changed

## Elaborate: trampolines and bows

```step
stage: modify
tier: wider
insight: "Elastic potential energy completes the potential family and shows energy changing back and forth."
check:
  type: question
  q: "On a trampoline you land, sink down, and spring back up. Which energy is stored at the lowest point?"
  options: ["Elastic potential energy, in the stretched trampoline", "Kinetic energy, because you're moving fast", "No energy: you've stopped for an instant"]
  answer: 0
  feedback: [null, "At the lowest point you're still for an instant: no kinetic energy.", "The energy hasn't gone: it's stored in the stretched mat and springs."]
  explain: "Kinetic → elastic potential as the mat stretches, then back to kinetic and up to gravitational potential as you rise."
```

## Evaluate: look back

```step
stage: info
check: { type: reflect, text: "I compared my answer about the book on the shelf with what I now know about stored energy." }
```

Write one sentence: "At first I thought… Now I think… because…"

**Revision summary**

- **Kinetic energy** is energy of activity: movement, heat (thermal), sound, light, electrical.
- **Potential energy** is stored: chemical (food, fuel, batteries), gravitational (height), elastic (stretched or squashed).
- How much is stored depends on height and mass, how far something is stretched, or what a substance is made of.
- Energy changes between kinetic and potential, as on a roller coaster. The total stays the same.
