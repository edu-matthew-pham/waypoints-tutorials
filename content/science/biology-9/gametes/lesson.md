title: What makes a sex cell special?
summary: "Gametes (sperm and egg, or the nuclei in pollen and ovules) carry half the usual number of chromosomes, so fertilisation restores the full set. Each is specialised: sperm to swim and get in, the egg to feed the embryo and let only one sperm in."

In Year 8 you met specialised cells. This lesson: the cells made for reproduction.

## Engage: how many chromosomes?

```step
stage: predict
insight: "Students who think gametes have the full set won't see why fertilisation doesn't double the number; the answer sets up the 'half' idea."
check:
  type: predict
  q: "Your body cells have 46 chromosomes. How many does a human sperm or egg cell have?"
  options: ["46, like every other cell", "23: half", "92: double", "None: gametes have no nucleus"]
  actual: "23: half. When a sperm (23) fertilises an egg (23), the new cell has 46 again. If gametes had 46, the number would double every generation."
```

## Explore: a sperm and an egg

```step
stage: run
insight: "Clicking each feature and reading what it does links structure to the gamete's job."
try: { playground: board, starter: "boards.yml#gametes", height: 520 }
check: { type: board, text: "Find the nucleus and the special features of the sperm and the egg.", when: "n = k" }
```

Click each part to see what it is and what it does.

## Explain: built for the job

```step
stage: investigate
insight: "Matching each feature to the job it makes possible is the hinge; the chromosome number question checks 'half'."
tasks:
  - check:
      type: match
      q: "Match each feature to its job."
      pairs:
        - ["Sperm's tail", "Swims towards the egg"]
        - ["Midpiece full of mitochondria", "Releases energy for swimming"]
        - ["Acrosome", "Enzymes digest a way into the egg"]
        - ["Egg's food store", "Feeds the embryo in its first days"]
        - ["Jelly coat", "Changes after one sperm enters, so no others can"]
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "Why must a gamete have half the number of chromosomes?"
      options: ["So that when two gametes join, the new cell has the full number again", "Because gametes are small", "So the offspring has half as many genes", "To save energy"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "An egg is huge but still has 23.", "The offspring has the full number: half from each parent.", "It's about keeping the number the same each generation."]
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "Why are millions of sperm released, but only one egg?"
      options: ["Most sperm never reach the egg; the egg is large and costly to make because it holds food", "Many sperm join the egg, each adding some chromosomes", "Eggs are smaller", "Sperm have no nucleus"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "Only one sperm's nucleus joins the egg: its 23 chromosomes and the egg's 23 make 46.", "The egg is far larger.", "Each sperm carries a nucleus with 23 chromosomes."]
  - check: { type: reflect, text: "I can explain why gametes have half the chromosomes and how a sperm and an egg are specialised." }
```

### Features

### Half

### Numbers

### In your own words

In your book: draw a sperm and an egg, label three features, and write what each one is for.

## Elaborate: plants make gametes too

```step
stage: modify
insight: "Seeing pollen's tough wall (no tail) shows plant gametes solve the same problem, getting the male nucleus to the egg, another way."
try: { playground: board, starter: "boards.yml#pollen", height: 520 }
tasks:
  - check: { type: board, text: "Find the nucleus in the pollen grain and the egg, and the pollen's wall.", when: "n = k" }
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "A pollen grain can't swim. How does its male nucleus reach the egg?"
      options: ["Wind or animals carry the pollen to a flower; a pollen tube then grows down to the ovule", "It swims through the air", "The egg moves to the pollen", "It doesn't: plants don't use gametes"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "No tail: it is carried.", "The egg stays inside the ovule.", "Flowering plants reproduce sexually with gametes."]
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "A flowering plant's egg sits inside an ovule, deep in the flower's ovary. How does that suit its job?"
      options: ["It keeps the egg protected, and after fertilisation the ovule grows into a seed with a food store", "It lets the egg swim out to meet the pollen", "It stops pollen ever reaching it", "It is where the pollen is made"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "Plant eggs don't move: a pollen tube grows down to the ovule.", "A pollen tube grows through the flower to reach it.", "Pollen is made in the anthers; ovules hold the eggs."]
```

### Pollen

### Getting there

### The ovule

## Elaborate: counting chromosomes

```step
stage: modify
tier: wider
insight: "Applying 'half' to an unfamiliar organism checks the rule, not the number 46."
check:
  type: number
  q: "A dog's body cells have 78 chromosomes. How many are in a dog's sperm cell?"
  answer: 39
  explain: "Half of 78. The egg also has 39, so the puppy's cells have 78."
```

## Evaluate: look back

```step
stage: info
check: { type: reflect, text: "I compared my first answer about chromosomes in gametes with what I now know." }
```

Write one sentence: "At first I thought… Now I think… because…"

**Revision summary**

- **Gametes** are sex cells: sperm and egg in animals; the male nucleus in pollen and the egg in the ovule in flowering plants.
- Gametes have **half** the chromosomes (23 in humans), so **fertilisation** restores the full number (46).
- **Sperm:** tail, midpiece of mitochondria, acrosome. **Egg:** large, food store, a coat that lets in only one sperm.
