The particle model is not just a picture to label. In this lesson you use it to **explain** what solids, liquids and gases do.

## Engage: a jar of gas

```step
stage: predict
insight: "Students who think gases rise because they are light will predict the top; the jar shows spreading in every direction."
check:
  type: predict
  q: "A small jar of gas sits in the middle of a large, empty, sealed box. The jar is removed. A few seconds later, where is the gas?"
  options: ["Mostly at the top of the box", "Mostly at the bottom of the box", "Still in a jar-shaped clump", "Spread through the whole box"]
  actual: "Spread through the whole box: up, down and sideways. Its particles move fast in every direction."
```

The box has no air in it. Decide before you look.

## Explore: remove the jar

```step
stage: run
insight: "Releasing each state from the same jar makes the three behaviours directly comparable."
try: { playground: science, starter: "boards.yml#jar", height: 520 }
check: { type: board, text: "Remove the jar for the solid, the liquid and the gas.", expect: { done: true } }
```

Choose a state, then remove the jar. Do all three, and watch the particles each time.

## Explain: arrangement, motion, attraction

```step
stage: investigate
insight: "Describing each state by all three features, then explaining behaviour from them, is what stops diagrams being decorative."
tasks:
  - check:
      type: sort
      q: "Which state does each description belong to?"
      options: ["Solid", "Liquid", "Gas"]
      items:
        - ["Particles close together in a fixed pattern", "Solid"]
        - ["Particles close together with no pattern", "Liquid"]
        - ["Particles far apart", "Gas"]
        - ["Particles vibrate in place", "Solid"]
        - ["Particles slide past each other", "Liquid"]
        - ["Particles move fast in all directions", "Gas"]
        - ["Strong attraction between particles", "Solid"]
        - ["Weaker attraction: particles stay close but can move", "Liquid"]
        - ["Very weak attraction", "Gas"]
        - ["Keeps its shape", "Solid"]
        - ["Spreads across the bottom of its container", "Liquid"]
        - ["Fills its whole container", "Gas"]
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "Why does a gas spread to fill its whole container?"
      options: ["Gas particles are light and float", "Its particles move fast in all directions and barely attract each other", "Its particles expand to fill the space", "Air pushes it around"]
      answer: 1
      feedback: ["The gas spread downwards and sideways too, not just up.", null, "Particles never change size. The spaces between them grow.", "There was no air in the box, and the gas still spread."]
      explain: "Nothing holds gas particles together, so they spread in every direction until they fill the space."
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "Why does a solid keep its shape?"
      options: ["Its particles don't move", "Strong attraction holds its particles in fixed positions, where they vibrate", "Its particles are bigger", "It is heavier than a liquid"]
      answer: 1
      feedback: ["Solid particles vibrate. They don't leave their positions, because attraction holds them there.", null, "Particles of a substance are the same size in every state.", "Mass doesn't decide shape: ice keeps its shape and is lighter than the same volume of water."]
      explain: "Each particle vibrates but stays in its place, so the whole shape stays."
  - check: { type: reflect, text: "I wrote why juice spreads across a table but a sugar cube keeps its shape, using arrangement, motion and attraction, and I could point to a particle diagram for each sentence." }
```

### Describe each state

Watch the board while you sort. Every description fits exactly one state.

### Why gases fill

### Why solids keep their shape

### In your own words

In your book: explain why juice spreads across a table when a sugar cube keeps its shape. Use arrangement, motion and attraction, not just "because it's a liquid".

## Mix it up

```step
stage: practise
insight: "Bringing back the four key ideas of the particle model, which this lesson uses to explain solids, liquids and gases."
check:
  type: question
  q: "Looking back at the particle model: which statement about particles is true?"
  options: ["Particles are always moving, even in a solid", "The particles in a solid have stopped moving", "There is air between the particles of water", "Particles get bigger when they are heated"]
  answer: 0
  feedback: [null, "Solid particles vibrate in place. They never stop moving.", "Air is made of particles too. Between particles there is nothing at all.", "Particles never change size. Heated particles move faster and spread out."]
  explain: "Key idea 3: particles are always moving. In a solid they vibrate in place, held there by strong attraction."
```

## Elaborate: six substances

```step
stage: modify
tier: typical
insight: "Ranking substances by spacing, then checking real densities, shows what the model predicts well (the big gaps) and what it needs added (particle mass)."
try: { playground: science, starter: "boards.yml#six", height: 520 }
tasks:
  - check:
      type: sort
      q: "Using the spacing only, where does each substance belong?"
      options: ["Densest pair", "Middle pair", "Least dense pair"]
      items:
        - ["Iron (real density 7.87 g/cm³)", "Densest pair"]
        - ["Aluminium (2.70 g/cm³)", "Densest pair"]
        - ["Water (1.00 g/cm³)", "Middle pair"]
        - ["Cooking oil (0.92 g/cm³)", "Middle pair"]
        - ["Carbon dioxide (0.0018 g/cm³)", "Least dense pair"]
        - ["Air (0.0012 g/cm³)", "Least dense pair"]
      explain: "Spacing predicts the groups: solids and liquids close together, then a huge drop to the gases."
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "Iron and aluminium have the same spacing, but iron is almost three times denser. Why?"
      options: ["Each iron particle is heavier", "Iron particles are bigger", "Aluminium has air gaps in it"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "Bigger particles at the same spacing would mean fewer per cm³, not more mass.", "Solid aluminium has no air gaps."]
      explain: "Spacing explains the big groups; the mass of each particle explains differences within a group. The same goes for carbon dioxide and air."
```

### Rank by spacing

### Inside a pair

## Elaborate: heating one substance

```step
stage: modify
tier: wider
insight: "The same particles at different temperatures connect motion and energy to spacing."
try: { playground: science, starter: "boards.yml#heat", height: 500 }
tasks:
  - check: { type: board, text: "Heat the water from ice, through liquid, to steam.", expect: { done: true } }
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "When liquid water becomes steam, the space between the particles…"
      options: ["stays the same", "increases a lot", "decreases"]
      answer: 1
      feedback: ["Look at the steam on the board: its particles are far apart.", null, "Heating makes particles move faster and spread out, not pack closer."]
      explain: "Steam takes up roughly 1,700 times the volume of the same mass of liquid water."
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "What lets particles move further apart as water is heated?"
      options: ["They gain energy, so they can overcome the attraction", "The attraction disappears", "The particles shrink"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "The attraction is still there; faster particles can overcome it.", "Particles never change size."]
```

### From ice to steam

Drag the temperature slowly from −20 °C to 120 °C. Watch the motion and the spacing.

### Spacing

### Energy

## Elaborate: comparing attraction

```step
stage: modify
tier: wider
insight: "Boiling points are evidence for attraction strength: particles need more energy to pull apart when they attract more strongly."
check:
  type: parsons
  code: "attraction.txt#order"
  text: "Put the substances in order of attraction between their particles, strongest first."
  explain: "Higher boiling point means stronger attraction. Salt needs over 1400 °C; oxygen is already a gas at −183 °C."
```

To boil, a substance's particles need enough energy to pull completely away from each other. The stronger the attraction, the hotter it has to get.

## Elaborate: the odd one out, ice

```step
stage: modify
tier: wider
insight: "An anomaly is a chance to evaluate the model: water needs an extra detail, not a new model."
try: { playground: science, starter: "boards.yml#ice", height: 440 }
check:
  type: question
  q: "Most solids sink in their own liquid (solid wax sinks in melted wax), but ice floats on water. What does this mean for the particle model?"
  options:
    - "The model is wrong and should be thrown out"
    - "Water is a special case: frozen water particles lock into an open pattern with more space than in the liquid, so the model needs this extra detail"
    - "Ice floats because of air bubbles trapped inside it"
    - "Solid particles are always further apart than liquid particles"
  answer: 1
  feedback: ["A model that explains most cases is still useful. Scientists refine models when they meet an exception.", null, "Clear ice with no bubbles still floats.", "For almost every substance the solid is packed slightly more closely. Water is the exception."]
  explain: "The model keeps its core ideas and gains a detail. (The diagram exaggerates the gap: ice takes up about 9% more space than the same mass of water.)"
```

## Evaluate: look back

```step
stage: info
check: { type: reflect, text: "I compared my first prediction with what happened and can say what changed in my thinking." }
```

Where did you think the gas would be? Write one sentence: "At first I thought… Now I think… because…"

**Revision summary**

- **Solid:** close together, fixed pattern, vibrating in place, strong attraction. It keeps its shape.
- **Liquid:** close together, no pattern, sliding past each other, weaker attraction. It flows and spreads across the bottom of its container.
- **Gas:** far apart, moving fast in all directions, very weak attraction. It spreads to fill its whole container.
- A gas spreads in every direction, including down. It is not floating up.
