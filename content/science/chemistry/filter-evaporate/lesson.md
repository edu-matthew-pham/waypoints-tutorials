title: Filtration and evaporation
summary: Filtration separates a solid that hasn't dissolved; evaporation recovers a solid that has. Describe both, name the residue and filtrate, and choose the right one.
language: science
hook: "How do you get clean salt back out of sandy salt water? Two techniques, in the right order: filtration takes out what didn't dissolve, and evaporation takes the water away from what did."
---
Both techniques use a property difference from the last lesson: **particle size** for filtration, **boiling point** for evaporation. This lesson is about doing them correctly.

## Engage: sandy salt water

```step
stage: predict
insight: "The common error is thinking the filter catches dissolved salt too."
check:
  type: predict
  q: "Sandy salt water is poured through filter paper. What stays in the paper?"
  options: ["Sand only", "Sand and salt", "Salt only", "Nothing"]
  actual: "Sand only. Dissolved salt particles are small enough to pass through with the water, and come back when the water evaporates."
```

## Explore: filter, then evaporate

```step
stage: run
insight: "Seeing the particles at each stage makes residue, filtrate and crystals concrete."
try: { playground: science, starter: "boards.yml#filter", height: 500 }
tasks:
  - starter: "boards.yml#filter"
    check: { type: board, text: "Pour the sandy salt water through the filter paper.", expect: { done: true } }
  - starter: "boards.yml#evaporate"
    check: { type: board, text: "Heat the filtrate until the water has gone.", expect: { done: true } }
  - check:
      type: sort
      q: "Name what you got."
      options: ["Residue", "Filtrate", "Salt crystals"]
      items:
        - ["The sand left in the filter paper", "Residue", "The solid left behind."]
        - ["The salty water that came through the paper", "Filtrate", "The liquid that passes through."]
        - ["What was left in the dish after evaporating", "Salt crystals", "The salt never left; only the water did."]
```

### Filtration

The dashed line is the filter paper. Its holes are smaller than a sand grain.

### Evaporation

The board loads the filtrate in an evaporating dish.

### Name the parts

## Explain: get the steps in order

```step
stage: investigate
insight: "The node's response mode is consolidation: procedural accuracy is the target, so order the steps exactly."
tasks:
  - check:
      type: parsons
      code: "steps.txt#filtration"
      text: "Put the filtration steps in order."
      explain: "Pouring slowly stops the mixture overflowing the paper."
  - check:
      type: parsons
      code: "steps.txt#evaporation"
      text: "Put the evaporation steps in order."
      explain: "Stopping before the dish is completely dry stops the salt spitting."
```

### Filtration

### Evaporation

## Practise: which technique?

```step
stage: practise
insight: "Choosing between filtration, evaporation, both or neither, with feedback, builds the habit of asking 'did it dissolve?'"
try: { playground: science, starter: "boards.yml#quiz", height: 320 }
check: { type: board, text: "Choose the right technique six times.", expect: { done: true } }
```

For each mixture, choose what you would use to get the part named. Start by asking: did it dissolve?

## Elaborate: design a procedure

```step
stage: modify
tier: typical
insight: "Designing the procedure for a dry mixture needs the dissolving step first, which students often miss."
tasks:
  - check:
      type: parsons
      code: "steps.txt#design"
      text: "You have a dry mixture of sand and salt. Order the steps to end up with dry sand and salt crystals, separately."
      explain: "Dissolving first is the key move: the salt has to be in solution before the filter can separate it from the sand."
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "During filtering, which particles pass through the paper?"
      options: ["Water and salt particles", "All the particles", "Only water particles"]
      answer: 0
      explain: "Dissolved salt particles are small enough to fit through with the water."
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "During evaporation, which particles leave the dish?"
      options: ["Only water particles", "Water and salt", "Only salt"]
      answer: 0
      explain: "Water boils far below salt."
```

### The procedure

### Through the paper

### Out of the dish

## Elaborate: out in the world

```step
stage: modify
tier: wider
insight: "Spotting filtration and evaporation in everyday settings checks the techniques are understood, not memorised."
check:
  type: sort
  q: "Filtration or evaporation?"
  options: ["Filtration", "Evaporation"]
  items:
    - ["A coffee machine holds the grounds in a paper cone.", "Filtration", "Grounds don't dissolve; the coffee is the filtrate."]
    - ["Shallow sea-salt ponds are left in the sun for weeks.", "Evaporation", "Sun and wind evaporate the water, leaving salt."]
    - ["A pool pump pushes water through a sand or cartridge filter.", "Filtration", "Leaves, dirt and hair are trapped."]
    - ["Wet clothes on a washing line dry out.", "Evaporation", "Water particles escape into the air."]
```

## Elaborate: First Nations separation techniques

```step
stage: modify
tier: wider
insight: "Traditional techniques use the same property differences as lab methods."
check:
  type: sort
  q: "Which property difference does each technique use?"
  options: ["Some parts are lighter than others", "Some parts are bigger or look different", "Different boiling points"]
  items:
    - ["Winnowing: seeds are tossed in a coolamon so the breeze carries the husks away.", "Some parts are lighter than others", "Husks are lighter for their size than seeds."]
    - ["Yandying: the coolamon is rocked in a rhythm so seeds and heavier grit move to different parts of the dish.", "Some parts are lighter than others", "Grit is heavier than seed, so it moves differently when shaken."]
    - ["Hand-picking: sticks and stones are picked out of the seeds by hand.", "Some parts are bigger or look different", "They are easy to see and grab."]
```

Many Aboriginal communities have long processed grass seeds into flour. A coolamon, a shallow wooden dish, is one of the tools used.

## Elaborate: does the filter paper matter?

```step
stage: modify
tier: wider
insight: "A variable investigation (filter paper grade) shows the trade-off between clarity and time, explained by particle size."
tasks:
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "What is the pattern in the results?"
      options: ["Finer paper gives a clearer filtrate but takes longer", "Coarser paper is better in every way", "There is no pattern"]
      answer: 0
      explain: "Clarity and speed trade off."
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "Why is the fine paper's filtrate clearer?"
      options: ["Its smaller holes trap smaller mud particles", "It soaks up the mud", "The water goes slower, so the mud is lighter"]
      answer: 0
      explain: "Particle size versus hole size."
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "Why does the fine paper take longer?"
      options: ["Smaller holes let less water through each second", "The water gets heavier", "The mud dissolves"]
      answer: 0
      explain: "Less space to flow through, and trapped mud blocks holes too."
```

A class filtered 100 mL of the same muddy water through three grades of filter paper. (Sample results, not measured.)

| Filter paper | Time to filter | Filtrate |
|---|---|---|
| Coarse | 30 s | Cloudy |
| Medium | 75 s | Slightly cloudy |
| Fine | 180 s | Clear |

What did you think would stay in the filter paper? Write one sentence: "At first I thought… Now I think… because…"

**Revision summary**

- Filtration separates an undissolved solid from a liquid. The solid left in the paper is the **residue**; the liquid that passes through is the **filtrate**.
- It works because the solid's particles are too big for the holes. Dissolved particles pass straight through.
- Evaporation separates a dissolved solid from the liquid: the liquid's particles escape as a gas; the solid's particles stay and form crystals.
- For a solid that dissolves plus one that doesn't: filter first, then evaporate the filtrate.
