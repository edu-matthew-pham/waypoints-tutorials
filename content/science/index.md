title: Science
map: true
trail: units
summary: Short concept tutorials for introducing an idea or revising it, built around particle simulations. Each one is a mini 5E cycle (Engage, Explore, Explain, Elaborate, Evaluate) for one idea in the curriculum. They sit beside practical work and class discussion, never instead of it.
pathways:
  - id: chemistry
    title: Chemistry
    summary: The particle model, mixtures, atoms and compounds, chemical change, then reactions at the level of atoms.
    fit: "Start here to see what everything is made of, and why substances mix, separate and change."
    about: "**Year 7 Chemistry** follows AC9S7U05 (particle theory) and AC9S7U06 (pure substances and mixtures): one tutorial per hinge idea, plus filtration, evaporation, distillation and chromatography. **Year 8 Chemistry** upgrades the particles to atoms (AC9S8U06) and defines chemical change (AC9S8U07). **Years 9 and 10 Chemistry** open up the atom (AC9S9U06), follow the atoms through reactions and balanced equations (AC9S9U07), explain the periodic table with electron shells (AC9S10U06) and reaction rates with collision theory (AC9S10U07). Nodes whose response is a class task (such as choosing a separation technique, or conservation of mass in open and closed systems) are left to class work."

  - id: biology
    title: Biology
    summary: Classification and food webs, cells and organs, coordination and reproduction, then genetics and evolution.
    fit: "Start here to explore living things, from food webs and cells to genes and evolution."
    about: "**Year 7 Biology** follows AC9S7U01 (classification) and AC9S7U02 (food webs). **Year 8 Biology** follows AC9S8U01 (cells) and AC9S8U02 (specialised cells, tissues and organs). **Year 9 Biology** follows AC9S9U01 (coordination and homeostasis) and AC9S9U02 (reproduction). **Year 10 Biology** follows AC9S10U01 (genetics and inheritance) and AC9S10U02 (variation and natural selection). One tutorial per hinge idea; nodes whose response is a class task are left to class work."

  - id: physics
    title: Physics
    summary: Forces and motion, how energy moves, and Newton's laws.
    fit: "Start here to push, pull and launch things, and follow where the energy goes."
    courses:
      - { path: science/physics-7, stage: foundations, tagline: "Forces as arrows, balanced or not." }
      - { path: science/physics-8, stage: foundations, after: [science/physics-7], tagline: "Energy on the move: kinetic, stored and transferred." }
      - { path: science/physics-9, stage: extensions, after: [science/physics-8, science/chemistry#particles], tagline: "Heat transfer, and why energy is never lost." }
      - { path: science/physics-10, stage: extensions, after: [science/physics-9], tagline: "Newton's laws and F = ma." }
  - id: earth-space
    title: Earth and space
    summary: The Earth, sun and moon; rocks, Earth's layers and moving plates; the carbon cycle; the big bang and Earth's energy balance.
    fit: "Start here to explore the Earth, the moon and the sky, from seasons to the big bang."
    about: "**Year 7 Earth and space** follows AC9S7U03 (the Earth, sun and moon). **Year 8** follows AC9S8U04 (igneous rocks) and AC9S8U03 (Earth's layers and plates). **Year 9** follows AC9S9U03 (Earth's spheres and the carbon cycle). **Year 10** follows AC9S10U03 (the big bang and redshift) and AC9S10U04 (sunlight, energy balance and the greenhouse effect). One tutorial per hinge idea, plus a few others the same boards cover; nodes whose response is a class task are left to class work."
