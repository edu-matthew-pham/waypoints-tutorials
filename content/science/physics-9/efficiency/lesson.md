title: How much is useful?
introduces: [efficiency]
summary: "Efficiency is the share of the energy put in that comes out as useful energy: efficiency = useful energy out ÷ total energy in × 100%. No real device is 100% efficient, because some energy always becomes by-products, usually heat. A device can give out more useful energy and still be less efficient."

Energy is never lost. This lesson asks how much of it does what you want.

## Engage: two bulbs

```step
stage: predict
insight: "Students who judge efficiency by the amount of useful output, not the proportion, pick the big bulb; the ratio is the hinge."
check:
  type: predict
  q: "Bulb A takes in 100 J and gives out 10 J of light. Bulb B takes in 20 J and gives out 8 J of light. Which is more efficient?"
  options: ["Bulb B: 40% of its energy becomes light, against 10% for A", "Bulb A: it gives out more light", "They are the same", "You can't tell without knowing the heat"]
  actual: "Bulb B. Efficiency is a proportion: 8 ÷ 20 = 40% for B, 10 ÷ 100 = 10% for A. A gives out more light but wastes far more energy doing it."
```

## Explore: build the diagrams

```step
stage: run
insight: "Setting each output so the diagram balances makes students account for all the energy before the efficiency appears."
try: { playground: board, starter: "boards.yml#filament", height: 680 }
tasks:
  - starter: "boards.yml#filament"
    check: { type: board, text: "A filament bulb takes in 100 J and gives out 10 J of light. Set the outputs so every joule is accounted for.", when: "u = 10 and b = 1" }
  - starter: "boards.yml#led"
    check: { type: board, text: "An LED bulb takes in 100 J and gives out 40 J of light. Set its outputs.", when: "u = 40 and b = 1" }
```

### Filament bulb

Use the sliders or + and −. The board tells you when the outputs add up to the input.

### LED bulb

## Explain: calculating efficiency

```step
stage: investigate
insight: "Applying the formula in several contexts, then explaining why it can't reach 100% and why it's a proportion, is the node."
tasks:
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "Which is the formula for efficiency?"
      options: ["Useful energy out ÷ total energy in × 100%", "Total energy in ÷ useful energy out", "Useful energy out − wasted energy"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "That would give more than 100%.", "That's not a proportion."]
      explain: "Efficiency is the useful share of what goes in."
  - check:
      type: number
      q: "A kettle takes in 2000 J and 1800 J goes into heating the water. What is its efficiency (%)?"
      answer: 90
      explain: "1800 ÷ 2000 × 100% = 90%."
  - check:
      type: number
      q: "An electric motor takes in 500 J and does 150 J of useful work lifting a load. What is its efficiency (%)?"
      answer: 30
      explain: "150 ÷ 500 × 100% = 30%. The other 350 J becomes heat and sound."
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "Why can no real device be 100% efficient?"
      options: ["Some energy always becomes by-products, usually heat from friction and resistance", "Energy is destroyed in every device", "Devices wear out"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "Energy is never destroyed: it is transferred somewhere not useful.", "Wearing out is a different problem."]
      explain: "Every moving part and every wire turns a little energy into heat. Better design reduces it, but never to zero."
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "Motor A takes in 500 J and does 150 J of useful work (30%). Motor B takes in 200 J and does 100 J (50%). What does the difference mean?"
      options: ["B turns a bigger share of its input into useful work, so for the same job it needs less energy in and wastes less", "A is more efficient, because it does more useful work", "They are equally good, because both obey conservation of energy"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "That's the amount, not the share. Efficiency compares useful out with total in.", "Both conserve energy, but A wastes 70% of its input and B only 50%."]
      explain: "For every 100 J in, B gives 50 J of useful work and A only 30 J. To do the same job, B needs less energy in."
  - check: { type: reflect, text: "I can calculate efficiency and explain why it is always less than 100%." }
```

### The formula

### The kettle

### The motor

### Never 100%

### Two motors

### In your own words

In your book: work out the efficiency of each bulb you built. Then write one sentence explaining why a bulb that gives out more light can still be less efficient.

## Elaborate: a car engine

```step
stage: modify
tier: typical
insight: "A device with two by-products checks that every output is counted and that efficiency uses only the useful one."
try: { playground: board, starter: "boards.yml#engine", height: 680 }
tasks:
  - check: { type: board, text: "A car engine: 100 J of chemical energy in fuel gives 25 J of movement, 65 J of heat and 10 J of sound. Build its diagram.", when: "u = 25 and b = 1" }
  - check:
      type: number
      q: "What is the engine's efficiency (%)?"
      answer: 25
      explain: "25 ÷ 100 × 100% = 25%. Three quarters of the fuel's energy heats the engine, the exhaust and the air."
```

### The engine

### Its efficiency

## Elaborate: energy star ratings

```step
stage: modify
tier: wider
insight: "Energy ratings turn efficiency into a buying decision and connect it to cost and emissions."
check:
  type: question
  q: "Two fridges keep food equally cold. One has a 6-star energy rating and the other 3 stars. What does the extra efficiency mean?"
  options: ["The 6-star fridge needs less electrical energy for the same cooling, so it costs less to run and needs less electricity generated", "The 6-star fridge makes food colder", "Nothing: stars are about size"]
  answer: 0
  feedback: [null, "The cooling is the same; the energy needed is not.", "Energy ratings are about how much energy a model uses."]
  explain: "More efficient devices waste less energy as heat, so less energy has to be generated in the first place."
```

## Evaluate: look back

```step
stage: info
check: { type: reflect, text: "I compared my prediction about the two bulbs with the efficiencies I calculated." }
```

Write one sentence: "At first I thought… Now I think… because…"

**Revision summary**

- **Efficiency** = useful energy out ÷ total energy in × 100%.
- It is a **proportion**: a device that gives out more useful energy can still be less efficient.
- No real device is 100% efficient: some energy always becomes by-products, usually heat.
- More efficient devices need less energy input for the same job.
