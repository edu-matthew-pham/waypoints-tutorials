title: "Quick check: mitosis, fertilisation and sex-linked traits"
summary: "A few quick questions on mitosis, how fertilisation and meiosis give variation among siblings, and sex-linked inheritance. Taught in class; use this to check yourself."
language: science
hook: "Siblings share both parents but are not copies of each other. And why do some conditions show up more in boys?"
---
Your teacher covers these in class. The questions check the basics: what mitosis does, how offspring get their genes, and why sex-linked traits behave differently.

## Mitosis

```step
stage: investigate
insight: "Node 2: two identical daughter cells with the same chromosome number, for growth and repair."
tasks:
  - check: {"type":"question","q":"A body cell with 46 chromosomes divides by mitosis. What does each daughter cell have?","options":["46 chromosomes, genetically identical to the parent cell","23 chromosomes, different from the parent","46 chromosomes, all different from each other","92 chromosomes"],"answer":0,"feedback":[null,"Halving the number is meiosis.","Mitosis makes identical cells, not different ones.","The number stays the same; it does not double."],"explain":"Mitosis copies the chromosomes and shares them equally, so each daughter cell is a genetic copy with the full number."}
  - check: {"type":"sort","q":"Is it mitosis or meiosis?","options":["Mitosis","Meiosis"],"items":[["Makes two identical cells","Mitosis"],["Makes gametes","Meiosis"],["Used for growth and repair","Mitosis"],["Halves the chromosome number","Meiosis"],["Keeps the chromosome number the same","Mitosis"]]}
  - check: {"type":"reflect","text":"I can say what mitosis produces and why the body needs it."}
```

### The outcome

### Mitosis or meiosis?

### I can

## Fertilisation and heredity

```step
stage: investigate
insight: "Node 5: from parent genotypes to offspring, why siblings differ, and what Punnett ratios mean."
tasks:
  - check: {"type":"question","q":"Each human gamete has 23 chromosomes. How many does a fertilised egg have?","options":["46: one set from each parent","23: the same as a gamete","92: two copies from each parent","Any number"],"answer":0,"feedback":[null,"That is only one parent's set.","Each parent gives one set of 23, not two.","The number is always the same for a species."],"explain":"Fertilisation joins two gametes, restoring the full number in the next generation."}
  - check: {"type":"question","q":"Why can two children of the same parents have different genes?","options":["Meiosis shuffles the genes into different gametes, and which sperm meets which egg is random","Younger children get more of their genes from the mother","Siblings always get the same genes","Each child gets an exact blend of both parents"],"answer":0,"feedback":[null,"Every child gets half of its chromosomes from each parent, whatever their birth order.","Only identical twins share all their genes.","If children were exact blends, siblings would all be the same."],"explain":"Each gamete is a different mix, and fertilisation combines two at random, so every child gets a different combination (except identical twins)."}
  - check: {"type":"question","q":"Two parents are both Bb (B dominant). What is the chance of a child with genotype bb?","options":["1 in 4 (25%)","1 in 2 (50%)","3 in 4 (75%)","0"],"answer":0,"feedback":[null,"Half would be Bb.","Three in four show the dominant trait, but bb is one in four.","Both parents carry b, so it is possible."],"explain":"Each parent passes B or b with equal chance, so the four combinations BB, Bb, Bb and bb are equally likely: bb is one of the four."}
  - check: {"type":"question","q":"A parent has the genotype Bb. What gametes can they make?","options":["Half carry B and half carry b","All carry Bb","All carry B, because it is dominant","B and b in a 3 to 1 ratio"],"answer":0,"feedback":[null,"Gametes carry one allele of each gene, not two.","Dominant decides how the trait shows, not which allele a gamete gets.","Meiosis shares the two alleles equally."],"explain":"Meiosis separates the pair, so each gamete gets one allele: B or b, equally likely."}
  - check: {"type":"reflect","text":"I can trace genes from parent genotypes through gametes to offspring, and say why siblings differ."}
```

### Putting it together

### Why siblings differ

### Punnett ratios

### From parent to gamete

### I can

## Sex-linked inheritance

```step
stage: investigate
insight: "Node 6: X and Y determine sex; X-linked recessive traits are more common in males."
tasks:
  - check: {"type":"question","q":"Which chromosome pair makes a person female or male?","options":["XX is female, XY is male","XY is female, XX is male","Another chromosome pair decides; X and Y don't matter","The mother's chromosomes alone decide"],"answer":0,"explain":"The Y chromosome carries the gene that starts male development.","feedback":[null,"The Y chromosome carries the gene that starts male development.","X and Y are the sex chromosomes.","Every egg carries an X; the sperm carries an X or a Y, so it is the father's gamete that decides."]}
  - check: {"type":"question","q":"A mother is a carrier of an X-linked recessive condition (XN Xn). The father does not have it (XN Y). What fraction of their sons is expected to have the condition?","options":["Half","None","All","One quarter"],"answer":0,"feedback":[null,"A son who gets the mother's Xn will have it.","Half of the sons get the mother's Xn.","One quarter of all the children have it, but the question asks about sons: half of them do."],"explain":"Sons get the father's Y and one of the mother's X chromosomes: half get Xn, so half have the condition. Daughters get XN from the father, so none have it, though half are carriers."}
  - check: {"type":"question","q":"Why are X-linked recessive conditions more common in males?","options":["Males have only one X, so a single recessive allele is expressed; females need two","Males have two X chromosomes","The Y chromosome carries the condition","Females never carry the allele"],"answer":0,"feedback":[null,"Males have one X and one Y.","The condition is on the X, not the Y.","Females can be carriers."],"explain":"A female can have a normal second X that masks the recessive allele. A male has no second X."}
  - check: {"type":"question","q":"The same parents (XN Xn and XN Y). What about their daughters?","options":["None are expected to have the condition, and half are expected to be carriers","Half have the condition","All are carriers","One quarter have the condition"],"answer":0,"feedback":[null,"Every daughter gets XN from her father, which masks Xn.","Half get XN from the mother, so they are not carriers.","To have it, a daughter would need Xn from both parents."],"explain":"Daughters get the father's XN and one of the mother's X chromosomes: XN XN or XN Xn. None have it; half carry it."}
  - check: {"type":"reflect","text":"I can say how sex is determined and use a Punnett square to predict an X-linked trait in sons and daughters."}
```

### Sex chromosomes

### A Punnett square

### Why more in males?

### Daughters
