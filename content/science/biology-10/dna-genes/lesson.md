title: Where are the instructions?
summary: "DNA carries the instructions for an organism. It is coiled into chromosomes in the nucleus; a gene is a section of DNA that codes for a protein. Alleles are different versions of the same gene."

In Year 9 you learnt gametes carry half the chromosomes. This lesson: what a chromosome is made of, and what a gene is.

## Engage: bigger or smaller?

```step
stage: predict
insight: "Students who confuse gene, chromosome and DNA can't order them by size; the zoom puts them in order."
check:
  type: predict
  q: "Put these in order from biggest to smallest: gene, chromosome, nucleus, DNA molecule."
  options: ["Nucleus, chromosome, gene, DNA", "Nucleus, chromosome, DNA molecule, gene (a section of it)", "Gene, chromosome, DNA, nucleus", "Chromosome, nucleus, gene, DNA"]
  actual: "Nucleus, then chromosome (one long, coiled DNA molecule), then a gene, which is a short section of that DNA."
```

## Explore: zoom in

```step
stage: run
insight: "Zooming from a person to one gene in six steps shows each structure inside the last."
try: { playground: board, starter: "boards.yml#zoom", height: 540 }
check: { type: board, text: "Zoom all the way in from the body to a single gene.", when: "l = 5" }
```

Press **Zoom in** and read each level before going on.

## Explain: DNA, genes and alleles

```step
stage: investigate
insight: "Separating the gene (the section of DNA) from the allele (a version) and the characteristic is the hinge."
tasks:
  - check:
      type: match
      q: "Match each word to its meaning."
      pairs:
        - ["DNA", "A long molecule carrying the coded instructions"]
        - ["Chromosome", "One long DNA molecule, tightly coiled"]
        - ["Gene", "A section of DNA that codes for one protein"]
        - ["Allele", "One version of a gene"]
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "One gene decides your blood group, yet people have blood group A, B, AB or O. How?"
      options: ["People have different alleles (versions) of the same gene", "There is a separate gene for each blood group", "The environment decides", "Only some people have the gene"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "It's one gene in the same place on the chromosome; its versions differ.", "Blood group is set by your genes, not by what happens to you.", "Everyone has the gene; the version differs."]
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "Your body cells have 46 chromosomes. Why are they described as 23 pairs?"
      options: ["One of each pair came from each parent, and the two carry the same genes (perhaps different alleles)", "Each chromosome copies itself", "Boys and girls have different chromosomes", "Pairs are easier to count"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "Copying happens before division, but the pairs come from the two parents.", "Only one pair (the sex chromosomes) differs.", "There's a biological reason."]
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "Someone has the blood group alleles A and O, and their blood group is A. Which is their genotype and which their phenotype?"
      options: ["Genotype: the alleles A and O. Phenotype: blood group A, the characteristic that shows", "Genotype: blood group A. Phenotype: the alleles A and O", "Both are 'blood group A': the words mean the same thing", "Genotype: the chromosome the gene is on. Phenotype: the gene"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "Swapped: the genotype is the genetic information (the alleles); the phenotype is what shows.", "They differ: someone with alleles A and A is also blood group A, with a different genotype.", "Genotype means which alleles you have, not where they are; the phenotype is the characteristic."]
  - check: { type: reflect, text: "I can explain how DNA, genes, chromosomes and alleles are related." }
```

### Words

### Alleles

### Pairs

### Genotype and phenotype

### In your own words

In your book: draw a nested diagram (cell, nucleus, chromosome, DNA, gene) and label an allele.

## Elaborate: from code to characteristic

```step
stage: modify
tier: typical
insight: "Ordering the steps from gene to characteristic answers 'what do genes do?'"
check:
  type: sort
  q: "Put the steps in order."
  options: ["1st", "2nd", "3rd", "4th"]
  items:
    - ["A gene's sequence of bases (A, T, C, G) is read", "1st"]
    - ["The cell builds a protein from that code", "2nd"]
    - ["The protein does a job (a pigment, an enzyme, a structure)", "3rd"]
    - ["A characteristic appears (such as eye colour)", "4th"]
```

## Elaborate: the same code everywhere

```step
stage: modify
tier: wider
insight: "Recognising that all cells hold the same DNA but use different genes links back to specialised cells."
check:
  type: question
  q: "A nerve cell and a skin cell from the same person have the same DNA. Why do they look and work so differently?"
  options: ["Each cell uses (switches on) different genes", "They have different chromosomes", "Skin cells lose most of their DNA", "Nerve cells have extra genes"]
  answer: 0
  feedback: [null, "The chromosomes are the same.", "They keep all of it.", "No extra genes: just different ones in use."]
```

## Evaluate: look back

```step
stage: info
check: { type: reflect, text: "I compared my first order of nucleus, chromosome, DNA and gene with what I now know." }
```

Write one sentence: "At first I thought… Now I think… because…"

**Revision summary**

- **DNA** carries coded instructions as a sequence of bases (A, T, C, G).
- A **chromosome** is one long DNA molecule, coiled; humans have 46, in 23 pairs (one of each pair from each parent).
- A **gene** is a section of DNA coding for a protein; **alleles** are different versions of one gene.
- **Genotype:** the alleles you have (such as A and O). **Phenotype:** the characteristic that shows (blood group A).
