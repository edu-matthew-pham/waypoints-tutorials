title: How can you tell a reaction happened?
summary: "You can't see atoms rearrange, but you can see the signs: a colour change, a gas given off, a solid forming in a liquid, light, a smell, or a temperature change. Each is a clue that a new substance formed, not proof: boiling water bubbles too. The test is still a new substance."

Last lesson: a chemical change makes a new substance. This lesson: how to spot one without seeing the atoms.

## Engage: fizz or no fizz

```step
stage: predict
insight: "Students often treat any bubbles or any temperature change as proof of a reaction; boiling water separates 'sign' from 'proof'."
check:
  type: predict
  q: "Which of these shows a chemical change has happened for certain?"
  options: ["None of them on its own: each is a clue, and the test is whether a new substance formed", "Bubbles appear", "It gets warmer", "It changes colour"]
  actual: "None of them on its own. Bubbles, warmth and colour change are all signs, but boiling water bubbles, a radiator warms things, and mixing paints changes colour, with no new substance. Signs are clues; the test is a new substance."
```

## Explore: signs on the board

```step
stage: run
insight: "Comparing a reaction (temperature rises, new particles) with dissolving (no new particles) shows which observations point to a new substance."
try: { playground: science, starter: "boards.yml#burn", height: 520 }
tasks:
  - starter: "boards.yml#burn"
    check: { type: board, text: "Burn the methane. Note the temperature at the start and the end.", expect: { done: true } }
  - starter: "boards.yml#dissolve"
    check: { type: board, text: "Now dissolve some salt. Any new kinds of particle?", expect: { done: true } }
```

### Burning

### Dissolving

## Explain: signs and the test

```step
stage: investigate
insight: "Listing the signs, then sorting cases where a sign misleads, keeps 'new substance' as the test and the signs as evidence for it."
tasks:
  - check:
      type: sort
      q: "Is it a sign of a chemical change?"
      options: ["A sign", "Not a sign"]
      items:
        - ["A colour change when two substances mix", "A sign"]
        - ["Bubbles of a new gas", "A sign"]
        - ["A solid forming when two clear liquids mix (a precipitate)", "A sign"]
        - ["Light or heat given out, or the mixture getting colder", "A sign"]
        - ["A new smell", "A sign"]
        - ["The substance changing shape", "Not a sign", "Cutting or bending changes the shape, not the substance."]
  - check:
      type: sort
      q: "Chemical change, or a sign that misleads?"
      options: ["Chemical change", "Misleading sign: physical change"]
      items:
        - ["A cake browning in the oven", "Chemical change"]
        - ["Vinegar and bicarb fizzing", "Chemical change"]
        - ["Water boiling and bubbling", "Misleading sign: physical change", "The bubbles are steam: still water."]
        - ["Blue and yellow paint mixing to green", "Misleading sign: physical change", "The paints are mixed, not changed."]
        - ["A nail rusting orange", "Chemical change"]
        - ["A hot drink cooling down", "Misleading sign: physical change"]
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "When magnesium burns there is a bright light, and a white powder is left. Which is the strongest evidence of a chemical change?"
      options: ["The white powder: a new substance with different properties from the shiny metal", "The bright light", "The magnesium getting hot"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "Light is a sign, but a light bulb glows without any new substance.", "Heating alone doesn't make a new substance."]
      explain: "A new substance with new properties is the test; the light and heat are signs that go with it."
  - check:
      type: match
      q: "Why does each sign suggest a new substance has formed?"
      pairs:
        - ["A colour change", "The new substance has a different colour from the starting ones"]
        - ["Bubbles of gas", "A new substance that is a gas has been made"]
        - ["A precipitate", "A new substance has formed that doesn't dissolve in the liquid"]
        - ["Heat or light given out, or getting colder", "Atoms rearranging into new particles gives out or takes in energy"]
        - ["A new smell", "Particles of a new substance are reaching your nose"]
      explain: "Each sign is a property of a new substance (colour, state, whether it dissolves, smell) or the energy of atoms rearranging. A physical change can show the same sign, which is why a sign is a clue, not proof."
  - check: { type: reflect, text: "I can list signs of a chemical change and explain why a sign is a clue, not proof." }
```

### Signs

### Clue or trap

### The strongest evidence

### Why each is a clue

### In your own words

In your book: list five signs of a chemical change. Next to each, give one example where the sign appears without a chemical change, if you can.

## Elaborate: melting gives signs too

```step
stage: modify
tier: typical
insight: "Melting and boiling show a temperature change and bubbles with no new substance, the clearest misleading signs."
try: { playground: science, starter: "boards.yml#melt", height: 520 }
tasks:
  - check: { type: board, text: "Heat the water from ice to steam.", expect: { done: true } }
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "As the water boils, it bubbles. Why isn't this a chemical change?"
      options: ["The particles are still water: no new substance forms", "Because it can be reversed", "Because no light is given out"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "Reversibility is not the test (dissolving salt can be reversed, and it's physical; so can some reactions).", "Lots of reactions give out no light."]
      explain: "The same particles, more spread out. Bubbles are a clue that misleads here."
```

### Boiling

### Not a reaction

## Elaborate: a precipitate

```step
stage: modify
tier: wider
insight: "A precipitate is a sign students meet less often; reasoning about it with particles checks the idea transfers."
check:
  type: question
  q: "Two clear solutions are mixed and the liquid goes cloudy with a fine yellow solid that settles. What does this suggest, and how could you check?"
  options: ["A new insoluble substance (a precipitate) formed; filter it out and test its properties", "One of the solutions has frozen", "Nothing new: the two solutions have just mixed, like two paints"]
  answer: 0
  feedback: [null, "Nothing has cooled enough to freeze.", "Two clear solutions that only mix give a clear mixture. A solid that wasn't there before points to a new substance."]
  explain: "A solid forming from two clear solutions is a strong sign of a new substance. Filtering it out and testing it is how a chemist would confirm it."
```

## Evaluate: look back

```step
stage: info
check: { type: reflect, text: "I compared my prediction about the signs with the boards and examples." }
```

Write one sentence: "At first I thought… Now I think… because…"

**Revision summary**

- Signs of a chemical change: a colour change, a gas given off, a precipitate, light, a smell, a temperature change.
- Each sign is a **clue**, not proof: boiling water bubbles and paint mixing changes colour, with no new substance.
- The **test** is whether a new substance formed, with new properties.
