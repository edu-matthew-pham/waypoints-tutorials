title: Why isn't salt poisonous?
summary: A compound is two or more types of atom chemically joined in a fixed ratio. It is a new substance with new properties, and a formula like H₂O tells you which atoms and how many.

Last lesson: atoms come in types, one for each element. This lesson: what happens when different types join.

## Engage: sodium and chlorine

```step
stage: predict
insight: "Students who think a compound is its elements mixed will predict it keeps their properties; salt shows a compound is a new substance."
check:
  type: predict
  q: "Sodium is a soft metal that fizzes and can catch fire in water. Chlorine is a poisonous green gas. When they react they make sodium chloride. What do you predict sodium chloride is like?"
  options: ["A poisonous metal", "A green gas that fizzes in water", "Something new, not like either of them", "Half metal and half gas"]
  actual: "Table salt: a white solid you can eat. When different atoms join, the new substance has new properties."
```

## Explore: mixed or joined?

```step
stage: run
insight: "The same two atom types, first mixed and then joined, separates 'compound' from 'mixture' at the particle level."
try: { playground: science, starter: "boards.yml#mixture", height: 520 }
tasks:
  - starter: "boards.yml#mixture"
    check: { type: board, text: "Inspect the particles in the mixture of hydrogen and oxygen.", expect: { done: true } }
  - starter: "boards.yml#compound"
    check: { type: board, text: "Inspect the particles of water.", expect: { done: true } }
```

### A mixture

Both boards contain only hydrogen and oxygen atoms. Look at how they are arranged.

### A compound

Same two atom types. What is different?

## Explain: compounds and formulas

```step
stage: investigate
insight: "Defining a compound by joining, fixed ratio and new properties, then reading formulas as atom counts, is the hinge for chemical change and equations."
tasks:
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "Both boards had hydrogen and oxygen atoms. What made water a compound and not a mixture?"
      options: ["Its hydrogen and oxygen atoms are chemically joined in each particle", "It has more atoms", "It is a liquid", "Its atoms are closer together"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "The number of atoms does not decide it. How they are arranged does.", "Being a liquid is a state, not what makes a compound. Steam is still water.", "The board's water particles were spread out like a gas. Joining is what matters, not spacing."]
      explain: "In a compound, different types of atom are chemically joined. In a mixture they are just together, not joined."
  - check:
      type: sort
      q: "Element, compound or mixture?"
      options: ["Element", "Compound", "Mixture"]
      items:
        - ["O₂", "Element", "One type of atom."]
        - ["H₂O", "Compound", "Hydrogen and oxygen atoms joined."]
        - ["CO₂", "Compound"]
        - ["He", "Element"]
        - ["Hydrogen gas and oxygen gas in one jar", "Mixture", "Two elements together, not joined."]
        - ["NaCl", "Compound"]
        - ["Air", "Mixture", "Several substances together, each with its own particles."]
        - ["N₂", "Element"]
  - check:
      type: match
      q: "Match each formula to the atoms in one particle."
      pairs:
        - ["H₂O", "2 hydrogen, 1 oxygen"]
        - ["CO₂", "1 carbon, 2 oxygen"]
        - ["NH₃", "1 nitrogen, 3 hydrogen"]
        - ["CH₄", "1 carbon, 4 hydrogen"]
      explain: "The small number belongs to the atom just before it. No number means one."
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "Water is always H₂O, never H₃O or HO. What does that tell you about compounds?"
      options: ["The atoms are joined in a fixed ratio", "Hydrogen is rarer than oxygen", "Water can be any mix of hydrogen and oxygen"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "There is more hydrogen than oxygen in water, by atom count. That isn't the point here.", "A mixture can be any ratio. A compound can't."]
      explain: "Every water particle has exactly 2 hydrogen atoms for each oxygen atom. A mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gases can be in any ratio."
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "Sodium fizzes in water and chlorine is poisonous, yet sodium chloride is safe to eat. Why?"
      options: ["It is a new substance: the atoms are joined, so it has new properties", "There is only a tiny amount of sodium and chlorine in it", "The sodium and chlorine are mixed in it, and cancel each other out", "The sodium and chlorine atoms changed into other kinds of atom"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "Salt is made of nothing but sodium and chlorine atoms, in a 1 to 1 ratio. The amount isn't the reason; joining is.", "If they were only mixed, each would keep its properties: the sodium would still fizz in water. In salt they are joined.", "The atoms are still sodium and chlorine. They are joined in a new way, and that gives the new properties."]
      explain: "A compound is a new substance. Its properties belong to the joined particles, not to the elements it was made from."
  - check: { type: reflect, text: "I explained why sodium chloride is safe to eat when sodium and chlorine are not, using the word compound." }
```

### Joined or mixed

### Sort them

### Reading a formula

The small number belongs to the atom before it: H₂O has **2** H and **1** O.

### Fixed ratio

### Why salt is safe

### In your own words

In your book: why can you eat sodium chloride when sodium and chlorine are both dangerous? Use "compound", "joined" and "new substance".

## Elaborate: find the compounds

```step
stage: modify
tier: typical
insight: "Reading formulas from particle pictures, and back, builds both directions of the representation."
try: { playground: science, starter: "boards.yml#many", height: 520 }
tasks:
  - check: { type: board, text: "Inspect all five gases.", expect: { done: true } }
  - check:
      type: number
      q: "How many atoms are in one particle of methane, CH₄?"
      answer: 5
      explain: "1 carbon + 4 hydrogen = 5 atoms."
  - check:
      type: number
      q: "Glucose is C₆H₁₂O₆. How many atoms are in one glucose particle?"
      answer: 24
      explain: "6 carbon + 12 hydrogen + 6 oxygen = 24 atoms."
```

### Inspect

### Count atoms

### A bigger formula

## Elaborate: making a compound

```step
stage: modify
tier: wider
insight: "Seeing elements join into a compound links this node to chemical change: the compound is a new substance made by rearranging atoms."
try: { playground: science, starter: "boards.yml#make", height: 560 }
tasks:
  - check: { type: board, text: "Watch hydrogen and oxygen react.", expect: { done: true } }
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "Hydrogen and oxygen are gases that let things burn. Water puts fires out. What does that show?"
      options: ["A compound has different properties from the elements it is made from", "Water is a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen", "The atoms changed type"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "If water were a mixture, it would still let things burn, like the gases do.", "Count the atoms in the panel: the same hydrogen and oxygen atoms, joined in a new way."]
```

### Watch

The panel shows the atoms at the start and now.

### New properties

## Evaluate: look back

```step
stage: info
check: { type: reflect, text: "I compared my prediction about sodium chloride with what it is really like, and can explain the difference." }
```

Write one sentence: "At first I thought… Now I think… because…"

**Revision summary**

- A **compound** is two or more **types** of atom **chemically joined** in a **fixed ratio**.
- A compound is a **new substance** with new properties (sodium chloride is not like sodium or chlorine).
- In a **mixture**, substances are together but not joined, and each keeps its properties.
- A **formula** gives the atoms in one particle: H₂O is 2 hydrogen and 1 oxygen.
