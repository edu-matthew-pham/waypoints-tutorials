title: Symbols, formulas or models?
summary: "Chemists show the same substance in different ways. A symbol names an element; a formula (H₂O) gives the types and numbers of atoms; a structural formula shows which atoms are joined; a 3D model shows the shape. Each shows something the others don't, so you pick the one that suits the job."

You can tell elements, compounds and mixtures apart by their particles. This lesson asks how to show them.

## Engage: what does H₂O tell you?

```step
stage: predict
insight: "Students often read the small 2 as applying to both symbols, or think the formula shows the shape; the options separate those readings."
check:
  type: predict
  q: "What does the formula H₂O tell you about a water particle?"
  options: ["It has 2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom", "It has 2 hydrogen atoms and 2 oxygen atoms", "It is a bent shape with the oxygen in the middle", "It is a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen"]
  actual: "2 hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom. The small number belongs to the symbol just before it; no number means 1. A formula tells you which atoms and how many, but not the shape: for that you need a model."
```

## Explore: models and formulas

```step
stage: run
insight: "Inspecting ball models beside their formulas, then reading models without symbols, shows what each representation carries."
try: { playground: science, starter: "boards.yml#three", height: 520 }
tasks:
  - starter: "boards.yml#three"
    check: { type: board, text: "Inspect each compound and compare its model with its formula.", expect: { done: true } }
  - starter: "boards.yml#nolabels"
    check: { type: board, text: "These models have no symbols. Inspect them: what can you work out from the colours and the number of balls?", expect: { done: true } }
```

### Formulas and models

The table gives each particle's formula and number of atoms.

### No symbols

Colours stand for elements here (red oxygen, white hydrogen, blue nitrogen), as in a model kit.

## Explain: what each one shows

```step
stage: investigate
insight: "Matching each representation to what it does and doesn't show, then choosing one for a purpose, meets the node's 'no single representation captures everything'."
tasks:
  - check:
      type: match
      q: "Match each representation to what it shows best."
      pairs:
        - ["Symbol (O)", "Which element"]
        - ["Formula (CO₂)", "Which atoms, and how many of each"]
        - ["Structural formula (O=C=O)", "Which atoms are joined to which"]
        - ["3D model", "The shape of the particle"]
        - ["Particle diagram of a box", "Whether it is an element, compound or mixture, and how much of each"]
      explain: "Each shows something; none shows everything."
  - check:
      type: number
      q: "How many atoms are in one particle of methane, CH₄?"
      answer: 5
      explain: "1 carbon and 4 hydrogen: 5 atoms."
  - check:
      type: number
      q: "How many oxygen atoms are in 3CO₂ (three carbon dioxide particles)?"
      answer: 6
      explain: "Each CO₂ has 2 oxygen atoms; 3 × 2 = 6. The big number in front counts particles; the small one counts atoms in each."
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "You want to show a friend that air is a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen. Which is best?"
      options: ["A particle diagram of a box with separate N₂ and O₂ particles", "The formulas N₂ and O₂", "A 3D model of one oxygen particle"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "Formulas name the substances but don't show that they are mixed, not joined.", "One particle can't show a mixture."]
      explain: "Pick the representation that shows what matters for the job: here, separate particles side by side."
  - check:
      type: match
      q: "Every representation leaves something out. Match each to one of its limits."
      pairs:
        - ["Symbol (O)", "It doesn't show how many atoms are joined in each particle (oxygen gas is O₂)"]
        - ["Formula (H₂O)", "It doesn't show which atoms are joined to which, or the shape"]
        - ["Structural formula (H–O–H)", "Drawn flat, it can hide the real 3D shape (water is bent)"]
        - ["3D model", "Slow to build or draw, and no use in a written equation"]
      explain: "Symbols and formulas are quick to write; a structural formula shows the joins; a 3D model shows the shape. Each has a limit, which is why chemists use several."
  - check: { type: reflect, text: "I can read a formula, and say what symbols, formulas and models each show." }
```

### Which shows what

### Atoms in methane

### Big and small numbers

### Choosing one

### What each leaves out

### In your own words

In your book: show carbon dioxide four ways (name, formula, structural formula, a ball drawing). Under each, write one thing it shows and one thing it doesn't.

## Elaborate: three more

```step
stage: modify
tier: typical
insight: "Reading formulas for less familiar substances, with the model to check, builds fluency."
try: { playground: science, starter: "boards.yml#more", height: 520 }
tasks:
  - check: { type: board, text: "Inspect all three substances.", expect: { done: true } }
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "Hydrogen peroxide is H₂O₂ and water is H₂O. What is the difference?"
      options: ["H₂O₂ has one more oxygen atom in each particle, so it is a different compound", "None: both are water", "H₂O₂ is a mixture of water and oxygen"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "The formulas are different, so the substances are different (hydrogen peroxide is a bleach).", "The atoms are all joined in one particle: a compound."]
      explain: "Change one small number and you have a new substance with new properties."
```

### Three substances

### One more oxygen

## Elaborate: where models mislead

```step
stage: modify
tier: wider
insight: "Knowing what a model leaves out (size, motion, the real shape in 3D) is part of using it well."
try: { playground: science, starter: "boards.yml#three", height: 520 }
tasks:
  - check: { type: board, text: "Inspect the compounds again, this time looking for what the model can't show.", expect: { done: true } }
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "Which of these does this flat ball model NOT show truthfully?"
      options: ["The real 3D shape, the real sizes and the huge empty space between particles", "Which atoms are in each particle", "How many atoms are in each particle"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "It shows the atoms correctly.", "The atom counts are right."]
      explain: "It is flat, the atoms aren't to scale, and real gas particles are much further apart. Every model simplifies; a good scientist knows how."
```

### Look again

### What it leaves out

## Evaluate: look back

```step
stage: info
check: { type: reflect, text: "I compared my reading of H₂O with the model on the board." }
```

Write one sentence: "At first I thought… Now I think… because…"

**Revision summary**

- A **symbol** (O, Na) names an element.
- A **formula** (H₂O, CO₂) gives the types of atom and how many of each. The small number counts the atom before it; a big number in front counts particles (3CO₂).
- A **structural formula** shows which atoms are joined; a **3D model** shows the shape; a **particle diagram** shows elements, compounds and mixtures.
- No single representation shows everything: choose the one that suits the job.
