title: What is an element?
summary: "An element is a pure substance made of only one type of atom. Its particles can be single atoms (helium) or atoms joined together (O₂), but every atom is the same type. Each element has a symbol of one or two letters, and the periodic table lists them all."

Last lesson: atoms come in types. This lesson: substances made of just one type.

## Engage: pure oxygen, pure water

```step
stage: predict
insight: "Students often think 'pure' means 'element', or that an element's particles must be single atoms; the options separate both ideas."
check:
  type: predict
  q: "A jar of pure oxygen and a jar of pure water. Both are pure substances. Which is an element?"
  options: ["Only the oxygen", "Only the water", "Both: they are pure", "Neither: oxygen particles have two atoms"]
  actual: "Only the oxygen. Every oxygen particle (O₂) is two oxygen atoms: one type of atom, so oxygen is an element. Water is pure too, but each particle has hydrogen and oxygen atoms: two types, so water is a compound."
```

## Explore: one type of atom?

```step
stage: run
insight: "Inspecting the particles of two pure substances side by side makes 'one type of atom' the test, not 'pure' or 'single atoms'."
try: { playground: science, starter: "boards.yml#oxygen", height: 520 }
tasks:
  - starter: "boards.yml#oxygen"
    check: { type: board, text: "Inspect the particles in pure oxygen.", expect: { done: true } }
  - starter: "boards.yml#water"
    check: { type: board, text: "Now inspect pure water vapour.", expect: { done: true } }
```

### Oxygen

Click a particle, or press **Inspect next particle**, to see which atoms it is made of.

### Water

The board names each kind of particle: element or compound.

## Explain: elements and symbols

```step
stage: investigate
insight: "Defining an element by atom type, then using symbols and their two-letter rule, sets up formulas for compounds next lesson."
tasks:
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "What is an element?"
      options: ["A pure substance made of only one type of atom", "Any substance made of single atoms", "Any pure substance"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "Oxygen (O₂) is an element, though its atoms come in pairs.", "Water is pure but it is a compound."]
      explain: "One type of atom, and nothing else. The atoms may be single (helium) or joined (oxygen, O₂)."
  - check:
      type: sort
      q: "Element or compound?"
      options: ["Element", "Compound"]
      items:
        - ["O₂ (oxygen)", "Element"]
        - ["He (helium)", "Element"]
        - ["N₂ (nitrogen)", "Element"]
        - ["O₃ (ozone)", "Element", "Three oxygen atoms: still one type."]
        - ["H₂O (water)", "Compound"]
        - ["CO₂ (carbon dioxide)", "Compound"]
        - ["NaCl (salt)", "Compound"]
  - check:
      type: match
      q: "Match each symbol to its element."
      pairs:
        - ["O", "Oxygen"]
        - ["C", "Carbon"]
        - ["Fe", "Iron"]
        - ["Na", "Sodium"]
        - ["Cu", "Copper"]
        - ["Au", "Gold"]
      explain: "Some symbols come from Latin names: Fe from ferrum (iron), Na from natrium (sodium), Cu from cuprum (copper), Au from aurum (gold)."
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "Why is the symbol for cobalt written Co, not CO?"
      options: ["A symbol is one capital letter, or a capital and a small letter; CO means a carbon atom joined to an oxygen atom", "It doesn't matter how you write it", "CO is the symbol for cobalt gas"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "It matters: CO and Co are different substances.", "There is no such gas; CO is carbon monoxide, a compound."]
      explain: "Each symbol starts with a capital. Co is one element (cobalt); CO is two symbols, C and O: carbon monoxide."
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "What does the periodic table show?"
      options: ["Every element, one box each, in order of atomic number, with similar elements in columns", "Every substance, including compounds", "Only the elements found in living things"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "Compounds aren't on it: only elements.", "It lists all 118 known elements."]
      explain: "About 118 elements are known; around 90 occur naturally. Everything else is made from them."
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "A box on the periodic table shows 26, Fe and Iron. What does each part tell you?"
      options: ["26 is the atomic number (its place in the table), Fe is the symbol and Iron is the name", "26 is the number of atoms in one particle of iron", "Fe is the formula of a compound of iron", "26 is the temperature iron melts at"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "The 26 isn't an atom count: it is iron's place in the table, its atomic number.", "Fe is one capital and one small letter: the symbol of one element. A compound's formula has two or more symbols.", "Iron melts at about 1500 °C. The whole number in the box is its atomic number: its place in order."]
      explain: "Each box gives an element's atomic number, symbol and name (often its atomic mass too). Find the name and you have the symbol, or the other way round."
  - check: { type: reflect, text: "I can define an element, tell an element from a compound by its atoms, and use chemical symbols." }
```

### What an element is

### Element or compound

### Symbols

### Co or CO

### The periodic table

### Reading a box

### In your own words

In your book: draw particles of an element made of single atoms, an element made of pairs of atoms, and a compound. Label each, and write the symbols you used.

## Elaborate: Co or CO?

```step
stage: modify
tier: typical
insight: "Inspecting carbon monoxide makes the capital-letter rule concrete: two capitals, two elements, a compound."
try: { playground: science, starter: "boards.yml#monoxide", height: 520 }
tasks:
  - check: { type: board, text: "Inspect the particles of CO.", expect: { done: true } }
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "CO is a poisonous gas from faulty heaters. Cobalt (Co) is a hard, shiny metal. How does the board show CO is not an element?"
      options: ["Each particle has a carbon atom and an oxygen atom: two types", "The particles are moving", "It has two letters"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "All gas particles move.", "Co has two letters too, and it is an element."]
      explain: "Two types of atom joined: a compound. Two capital letters in a formula mean two elements."
```

### Carbon monoxide

### Two capitals

## Elaborate: two forms of oxygen

```step
stage: modify
tier: wider
insight: "Ozone and oxygen are the same element in two forms, which breaks the idea that one element means one substance."
try: { playground: science, starter: "boards.yml#ozone", height: 520 }
tasks:
  - check: { type: board, text: "Inspect both kinds of particle.", expect: { done: true } }
  - check:
      type: question
      q: "Ozone (O₃) and oxygen (O₂) are both made of only oxygen atoms, but ozone protects us from ultraviolet light high in the atmosphere and is harmful to breathe. What does this show?"
      options: ["One element can form different substances when its atoms join in different ways", "Ozone must be a compound", "O₃ contains a different type of oxygen atom"]
      answer: 0
      feedback: [null, "Only one type of atom: it is an element.", "All the atoms are ordinary oxygen atoms."]
      explain: "Carbon does the same: diamond and graphite are both pure carbon. How the atoms are joined changes the properties."
```

### Oxygen and ozone

### One element, two substances

## Evaluate: look back

```step
stage: info
check: { type: reflect, text: "I compared my prediction about oxygen and water with the particles on the board." }
```

Write one sentence: "At first I thought… Now I think… because…"

**Revision summary**

- An **element** is a pure substance made of only one type of atom. Its particles can be single atoms (He) or atoms joined together (O₂, O₃).
- A **compound** has two or more types of atom joined (H₂O, CO₂).
- Each element has a **symbol**: one capital letter, or a capital and a small letter (C, Co, Na). Some come from Latin names (Fe, Na, Cu, Au).
- The **periodic table** lists all the elements, about 118.
