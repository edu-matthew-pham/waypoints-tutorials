# Roadmap: shared and general (site, build, shared tools)

Things more than one subject depends on: the build, publishing, the home and plain pages, and shared tools (`tools/*.mjs`, `tools/lesson-view.mjs`, `playground-shared/`, `playground-board/core.js`). Before changing one of these, check this file and `git log` for work in progress, and note here what you are changing.

## Done (11 Oct 2026): parallel clip recording

The publish workflow now records clips in parallel jobs: `plan` → `record` (matrix, default 4, set in the Run workflow form) → `publish`. `tools/render-shards.mjs` asks `render.mjs --seed --check` what needs recording and shares lessons out by clip count. `render.mjs` is unchanged, so this re-records nothing. Caches (11 Oct): the browser, pip, the Kokoro model (key: `tools/voice.mjs`) and spoken lines (`.voice-cache`: each record job uploads its lines, the publish job merges them with the last set and saves `voice-<run id>`; old lines are never pruned, so clear the cache in the Actions tab if it grows large). Picture seeding downloads 16 at a time (about 1 minute down to a few seconds in the plan job; `pictures()` is not part of any picture's hash, so nothing redraws). Sharing picture drawing between jobs is not worth it for normal runs (about 3.5 minutes) and would add a stage, since explain clips depend on the pictures; revisit if full redraws (after a `SHARED` bump, 558 pictures) become common. Not done yet: narrow the clip hash (`render.mjs` source and whole playground folders re-record every clip on any edit); one browser per job instead of per clip.

## Done (11 Oct 2026): cooling widget `steps`, igneous clip

`widget: cooling` takes `steps: N` (1 to 10 cooling steps per frame, same result). The recorder plays about 7 frames a second, so the igneous explain clip (Slow cooling, about 290 frames) never reached "Solid rock" inside the check's 10 s window and failed in CI; with `steps: 6` it records. Open: in this sandbox the clip is still about 67 s (over the 30 s guide) because every click takes 7 to 15 s on that page; check the real length in the next run's log (the over-30 s warning) and shorten the clip if it is long, for example one cooling run instead of two. Editing `playground-science/main.js` re-records every science clip once (27 lessons).

## Effort: "if coding is hard, why do it" (11 Oct 2026)

Students expect coding to be fun and easy and read struggle as failure. Response: cut friction (bad hard), keep and name the thinking (good hard). AUTHORING › Effort and struggle has the rules.

**Done (shared tools, all subjects):**
- Predict and Make stage notes say a wrong guess is fine and a few tries are normal (`STAGE_INFO*` in `lesson-view.mjs`).
- **Now you can** at the end of every lesson, from `teacher.yml` `goals` ("I can" dropped). Every lesson already has goals, so it shows everywhere.
- `teacher.yml` `struggle:` (where it is hard on purpose, what to say instead of rescuing): For teachers, teacher guide, slide notes on the first Modify or Make.
- Lint `tools/effort.mjs`: one summary line in validate; `npm run effort [path]` lists no `struggle:`, no `goals:`, and first hints that give the answer (solution code of 10+ characters not in the starter, or a number check's answer).

**To do:**
1. **Audit existing lessons**, course by course from `npm run effort` (230 without `struggle:`, 18 first hints flagged, mostly HTML/CSS; some are judgement calls). Add difficulty cues to reliably hard tasks while there. Editing `teacher.yml` changes the lesson folder's clip hash, so batch it per course before a publish.
2. ~~Friendly Python errors~~ **Done 11 Oct**: `tools/python-errors.mjs` in both Python playgrounds, tested by `npm run check-python-errors` and in a headless browser (CLAUDE.md › Playground runtime). Next: watch real student errors in class for slips it misses.

## Done: home page and plain pages (11 Oct 2026)

`content/index.md` `about:` renders on the home page (About, Why we made this, How the lessons work). Any other `content/<name>.md` is a plain page at `/<name>/`: `approach.md` (Why we teach this way; references checked) and `behind-the-scenes.md` (how lessons are made and checked, privacy). Claims stay true to what the tools do; checks not yet built are worded as aims.

## Shared: progression data and node check (decided 11 Oct 2026, not built; for maths and science)

The `introduces`/`assumes` scan suits code, where a dependency is a construct on screen; each subject has a different kind of dependency, so maths and science also get their own in-lesson checks (see their files).

- **Data:** export the kit's nodes and `prior_knowledge` for the covered descriptors into the repo (a small JSON file), and add `node:` (descriptor and node) to every maths and science lesson.
- **Check:** warn when a lesson's node depends on a node that no earlier lesson covers and that the lesson does not list in `assumes:` (taught in class). Without `assumes:` most science lessons would warn, since one tutorial per hinge node leaves most prior nodes to class teaching. It finds gaps between nodes only; ideas used inside a lesson that the kit does not record still need a read-through.

Build it once, in one chat, and note here who is building it before starting; the other subject then tags its own lessons.

**Built by the maths chat (11 Oct 2026).** Data as pasted progression pages (`data/progressions/<subject>/<code>.md`, the waypoints-kit markdown export, since the kit repo is unreachable from here; README there), parsed by `tools/progressions.mjs`. Lesson frontmatter `node:` and `uses:` (`tools/lesson-core.mjs` keeps them); `assumes:` also takes descriptor and node codes. Warnings in `validate.mjs`; `npm run nodes` (map) and `npm run check-nodes` (tests, `tools/check-progressions.mjs`). Only subjects in `CHECKED` (maths) must name a node: science adds `data/progressions/science/` pages, tags its lessons and adds itself to `CHECKED`. Rules: the node before in the descriptor, or the page's Prior Knowledge for node 1, plus `uses:`; earlier-year prerequisites count as taught in class; Related standards are ignored.

Also changed: `prerequisites()` in `tools/concepts.mjs` now treats a course listed with both `path` and `id` as one (an `after:` may name either), so `after: [number-foundations]` reaches `maths/number`. Code courses are unaffected (none has both).

## Changed by the science chat (12 Oct 2026): `woven:` for Human endeavour and Inquiry

Matthew approved. Lesson frontmatter `woven: [AC9S7H03, …]` lists woven-strand descriptors a lesson practises. `tools/lesson-core.mjs` keeps it; `tools/build-site.mjs` passes it to the map; `tools/curriculum-map.mjs` counts it as a whole-descriptor link (the card lists the lessons; the strand heading says how many are practised) and `WOVEN_NOTE` says so; `tools/validate.mjs` checks each code is a woven-strand descriptor in the subject's curriculum data. Maths has no woven strands, so its map is unchanged (checked).

## Changed by the code chat (11 Oct 2026)

- `tools/concepts.mjs`: Python concept `try` (try and except).

- `tools/build-site.mjs`: Playground and Reference entries for `code/deeper`. `snippets/turtle.json`: a Text and collections group. `misconceptions.json`: three Deeper Python misconceptions.

- `tools/build-site.mjs`: Playground and Reference entries for `code/objects` (same pattern as the console bridge). `tools/concepts.mjs`: Python concepts `object`, `attribute`, `class`, `method`. `snippets/turtle.json`: an Objects group. `misconceptions.json`: five Objects misconceptions.

- `BUILDING.md` › 7 and `CLAUDE.md` (runtime limits): the turtle playground now has several turtles and more shapes (`playground/`, code-owned).

- New plain page `content/check.md` (Check your school, `/check/`) with its script `site/check.js`, copied to `dist/check.js` by one line in `tools/build-site.mjs`; Behind the scenes links to it. For the in-browser Python courses only.

- `tools/build-site.mjs`: Playground and Reference pages for `code/console`, and Reference pages for `code/microbit-computer` and `code/microbit-security` (both use `snippets/microbit.json`). New optional fields: a `PLAY` entry can give `id` (its own saved program) and `code` (a starter); a `REFS` entry can give `groups` (only those groups of the file), `title` and `summary`. Other entries are unchanged.

- `tools/concepts.mjs`: added `CONCEPTS.html`; `visibleCode` now also reads `.html`/`.css` regions and fenced `html`/`css` blocks (other languages unchanged: their warnings are the same before and after). `tools/check-concepts.mjs`: HTML tests.
- New `tools/check-makecode.mjs` (`npm run check-makecode`, script added to `package.json`): static checks on MakeCode code tasks. Reads only; changes no shared behaviour.
- `misconceptions.json`: added `global-missing` (home `code/python/turtle-events`), and `text-plus-number`, `input-is-text`, `loop-never-changes` (console bridge).
- `BUILDING.md` › 7 and `CLAUDE.md` › Playground runtime: console mode in the turtle playground (`playground/`, code-owned).

## Done by the code chat (11 Oct 2026): Explain it to me as a help button

`tools/lesson-view.mjs`: the "Explain it to me" panel moves out of the top of every lesson (where its clip could show the Predict answer, as in Lesson 1) into a "?" button in the sticky step-pills bar that opens it as a drawer. Before the lesson's first Predict is locked in, the button says to make the prediction first. Affects every subject's lesson pages; no clip re-records (page HTML is not in clip hashes). Built: `.xbtn` first in `nav.steps`, `#xdrawer` (Esc or Close shuts it, video pauses), `EXPLAIN_JS` reads `wp-predict` for the first `.check[data-type=predict]` and unlocks live on the `wp-predict` event; lessons with no Predict open at once. Before the prediction, the button shows a small popover (`.xpop`, fixed under the button; hides after 4 s, on a click elsewhere, Esc or a real scroll) instead of opening the drawer. `check-html` now counts `#xdrawer video`. Tested at desktop and phone widths.

## Changed by the maths chat (11 Oct 2026)

- Form checks (Matthew approved Numbas, 11 Oct): `vendor/numbas/` (Numbas JME v11.0, Apache-2.0, English only, minified; rebuilt by `tools/numbas/build-jme.sh`), `tools/maths-forms.mjs` (checker, page script, Node loader). `tools/lesson-core.mjs`: `answer` checks take `form:` (and skip WPM checks on their answer and feedback). `tools/lesson-view.mjs`: such checks carry `data-form` and are marked by `WPF` on the page; lessons with one load `_numbas/numbas-jme.min.js` (deferred) and the checker script; other pages are unchanged. `tools/build-site.mjs` passes the script in `maths.forms`; `tools/build-playground.mjs` gains `buildNumbas` (copies to `dist/_numbas/`). `tools/validate.mjs` marks every form check's answer and feedback in Node. New `npm run check-forms` (`tools/check-forms.mjs`, `data/forms-cases.json`). Plain answer checks and board conditions still use WPM. New check type `working` (lesson-core, lesson-view, teach.mjs, validate): one step per line, marked by the same Numbas checker; CLAUDE.md check-types line updated.

- Maths cards can come from several files: `snippets/maths.json` plus `snippets/maths-<name>.json`, each naming its `course:` (`loadAllMathsCards()` in `tools/maths-cards.mjs`; `build-site.mjs`, `validate.mjs` and the maths section of `render-pictures.mjs` read them all). Existing cards, ids and picture hashes are unchanged.
- Shared board (`playground-board/`): new maths widget `widgets/parallel.js` with its script tag in `index.html` and `.pangles` styles in `style.css`; the graph widget gains the keyboard Move row (maths-only widget). No change to `core.js` or other widgets.

## Speculative: teach a novice ("Nib") (11 Oct 2026, discussion only)

An intention, not a rule; pilot it before anything becomes a design rule. Applies to every subject. The novice is **Nib** (see Nib and Nib's notebook, below): one non-human character across subjects, so the mistake never carries a real student's name. (Error-analysis tasks that use "Sam" can stay as they are.)

- **Intent:** after the worked example, the student explains the lesson's one new move to Nib, who holds one named misconception. Nib then tries a new case, run or checked on the board where possible, so a weak explanation fails visibly and a good one works.
- **Why:** learning by teaching (the protégé effect) and self-explanation, without an LLM: offline, no accounts, predictable, reusing the misconception data and `when:` checks. Easier to script than a Socratic tutor, which without an LLM reduces to the hint and feedback lessons already have.
- **Leanings:** write a one-line explanation before choosing from options (choosing alone tests recognition, not production); use it sparingly, at hinge nodes where the misconception has a visible consequence; only after the worked example; end with an own-words explanation compared with a model one. Not for recall or evaluate steps.
- **Teacher in the loop, light to heavy:** an on-screen "check this with your teacher" after two failed attempts; the own-words explanation as an exit ticket (nothing stored); later, perhaps an ephemeral live "stuck on step X" view in Kit or Prepare. The last one bends the no-tracking stance and needs a decision.
- **Later, maybe:** a teacher-led LLM version in Waypoints Kit (the AI as a novice scoped to one move), given age terms and answer leakage.
- **Open:** pilot lesson (the winch, or a maths hinge node); how authored options and branches are written in the lesson format.
- **First use (maths, 11 Oct):** the `reasoning` check follows "write, then choose, then compare": free working (not marked), a reason chosen at the key step (marked, with misconception feedback), then a model and a self-check. In *Reasoning with angles* and *Unknown angles in shapes*; no Nib yet.

## Speculative: Present mode, with a class signal later (12 Oct 2026, discussion only)

An intention, not a rule; pilot it on one lesson before deciding. Applies to every subject.

- **Why:** self-paced lessons, coding and theory alike, can feel like a chore: many small steps, a check after every action, and every idea arriving as text. Novices learn best from modelling, then guided, then independent practice (Rosenshine), and a prediction made in front of the class matters more than one made alone.
- **Intent:** the same lesson in two modes. **Present** (teacher drives, on the projector): one step per screen, large code or board, Predict with a reveal (mini whiteboards or hands), Run and Investigate live, the teacher thinking aloud. **Lab** (students drive): their lesson page from Modify onwards, with the earlier steps folded into a recap and checks mainly here. The self-paced path stays for catch-up, absent students and revision.
- **Leanings:** short follow-along only (students run the code, they don't type it); students do something every few minutes (vote, predict, spot a planted bug); a timer and the task on screen during Lab. Builds on what exists: board embeds, `?full=step-N`, explain clips and the Prepare decks; Present is a live view of the lesson page, so there's no export step.
- **Signal, later and separate:** the interactions that matter most work without data (whiteboards, hands, reading the room). A class signal would add a live prediction split for peer instruction ("convince your neighbour", re-vote) and "done" or "stuck on step N" during Lab. It bends the account-free, no-tracking stance, so it would be a separate classroom tool, never part of the tutorials: a session code, nothing kept after the session, no names or first names only.
- **Keep the door open:** stable ids on steps, tasks and predictions (mostly there already), so a signal tool can name "prediction 1 of Variables" without the tutorials knowing about it. Later, perhaps a small hook: when a session code is set, the lesson page posts a prediction or stuck status to that tool and stores nothing itself.
- **Open:** pilot lesson (Python Variables suggested); whether Present replaces the Marp decks or sits beside them; how a lesson marks where Present ends and Lab begins (default: at Modify).

## Speculative: width for faster students, support for stuck ones (12 Oct 2026, discussion only)

An intention, not a rule; pilot it before deciding. Applies to every subject. Replaces an earlier "test out" idea (skip to the Make), which was about speed.

- **Stance: depth first.** Learning Waypoints builds foundations through width: faster students go wider and deeper, not ahead (the mastery view, as in Teaching for Mastery and Singapore maths). Fast students can already skip the reading (nothing is locked); what they lack is something worth doing with the time they save.
- **Why (research):** PRIMM is supported for novices (Sentance, Waite and Kallia, 2019, about 500 students aged 11–14) and untested for intermediate or expert learners; for them the wider research applies: support that helps novices can get in the way of students who already know the idea (the expertise reversal effect, Kalyuga), and varied, combined practice builds transfer. Use–modify–create (Lee et al., 2011), which PRIMM builds on, already assumes students move towards open creation as they gain skill.
- **What students see:** one switch, **Steady / Advanced** (the existing width switch; the teacher's `?width=` link sets the starting level). Everyone does the same core path and checks, so the one new move and class discussion stay shared.
  - **Steady** (default): as Typical now.
  - **Advanced:** width means (1) more contexts, (2) **connections**: combining this lesson's idea with ideas taught earlier, and (3) explaining why (which line does what, why an edge case breaks, where a model stops working). Never new content. Investigate is lighter (prompts faded, worked example collapsed) but keeps the one key trace or reasoning question, so PRIMM's reading benefit stays and the foundation is shown. The time saved goes into Modify and Make, where the connections happen.
- **Below Steady: support on demand, not a level to choose** (choosing "Consolidating" carries stigma). It opens when a student is stuck, for example after two wrong answers ("Want another worked example?"); a teacher's link can switch it on from the start for a group. Already built: escalating hints, Explain it to me (clip, picture, text), the explanation after an answer, the Reference drawer, maths Practice pages. New: an extra faded worked example, an easier version of a task (Parsons or fill-in for a Modify), smaller Modify rungs.
- **By PRIMM stage:** Predict and Run the same for everyone; Investigate fuller with support, lighter on Advanced (key trace kept); Modify ladders smaller with support and further on Advanced (the last rung combines an earlier concept); Make smaller with a starter with support, and an integrating stretch plus "explain which line does what" on Advanced.
- **Who goes where (no tracking):** the teacher (per class by link; per student in the moment, from Present-mode whiteboards and the key trace); the lesson (from answers in this browser: a confident, correct Predict and key trace on the first try suggests Advanced; two wrong answers offer support; earlier lessons passed first try suggest Advanced as the start); the student (can always choose Advanced; the key trace still checks them). Suggestions, never locks.
- **Acceleration is the teacher's exception, not the site's offer.** Its evidence is good, especially subject acceleration in maths, but mostly from selected able students. Conditions: earned (the Advanced stretch done well, not just the core done fast) and never jumping a hinge node the student hasn't shown. The Advanced stretch doubles as that evidence. By subject: maths and coding allow it (pathways are already options, not gates); science mostly width (strands are largely independent, models spiral, practical work happens in class; Inquiry and Human endeavour tasks make natural Advanced stretches), acceleration at most within one strand's model sequence; Digital systems mostly width, linked to Code.
- **Rule change it needs:** AUTHORING says "Wider means more contexts, never harder content". It would become: Advanced may be harder only by combining ideas taught up to this lesson.
- **Lint:** the concept scan already knows each lesson's `introduces` and `assumes`; an Advanced step could be checked to use only concepts taught up to its lesson (validate warns on anything new).
- **Examples:** Python Variables: a spiral whose colour and size both change (lesson 1's loop with lesson 2's variable), then say which line controls which. Maths ratio: ratio with area or rates from earlier lessons, not proportion. Packets: which link to break when Wi-Fi loses packets and router C is busy (Wired or wireless with Packets).
- **In class:** pairs with Present mode (above): the teacher models the shared core; in Lab, Advanced students start on the stretch.
- **Open:** authoring cost (about 140 of 469 lessons have tiered steps, mostly extra contexts rather than connections, so an audit and new stretch tasks over time); whether below-Steady support is written per lesson or generated (Practice templates); how the old Minimum floor maps (probably: support on from the start); pilot course (Python Foundations suggested).

## Proposed: Nib and Nib's notebook (11 Oct 2026, discussed, not decided)

Replaces the Python-only "turtle companion" proposal (was in `roadmap/code.md`) with one character for every subject.

- **Nib:** a small, clearly non-human learner (a nib is a pen tip: it writes down what it is taught). Sits in the corner of course and lesson pages with a light CSS idle animation (blink, bob; still with reduced motion; can be hidden).
- **Nib's notebook:** clicking Nib opens what the student has taught it so far: the course's unlocked Reference cards (Python, web), maths cards, and later MakeCode blocks and science ideas, each with the lesson it came from. Gives maths and science an unlock moment they lack today.
- **Light gamification:** the notebook is a useful reference, not a score. One small moment when a page is added; no points, streaks or new badges beyond "Challenge complete". Per browser, built from existing progress data (`wp-progress`, `unlocks:`); no tracking.
- **Link:** the teach-a-novice step (above) is where Nib's pages come from, when a lesson has one.
- **Cost:** shared change (`tools/lesson-view.mjs`, `site/progress.js`, course pages); maths and science need a rule for which cards count as notebook pages. Snippet unlocks today: Python and HTML courses only; MakeCode, maths and science have none.
- New check type `reasoning` (Matthew approved 11 Oct; a first use of the teach-a-novice leaning "write before choosing"): `tools/lesson-core.mjs` (validation), `tools/lesson-view.mjs` (render, handler, `.rs-*` in MATHS_CSS, `wp-reasoning` storage), `tools/teach.mjs` (guides show the model steps). The free working is never marked; the answer and picked reasons are. AUTHORING and CLAUDE.md updated.
- `tools/maths-forms.mjs`: `subject x` accepts the subject in either case (Numbas already compares letters case-insensitively); case added to `data/forms-cases.json`.
- Board: geometry gains `angles: given …` and `exterior: C`; parallel takes several given angles (maths-only widgets).

## Proposed: other clips beyond Explain it to me (11 Oct 2026, discussed, not built)

Applies to every subject. The limits are the existing design rules: Predict comes before the new move, and new knowledge appears only in the worked example (or Investigate). So no clip may teach before Predict, and no "today we will learn" intro.

- **Hooks (phenomenon clips).** 10 to 20 s, little or no narration. A hook shows a situation without explaining it (the winch stalls, the sorter fails on a messy bench, a line tilts as m changes) and ends on the Predict question.
  - **Unit hook (the default):** one clip that sets the driving problem the unit returns to. Optional `hook:` clip in the course `index.md` `units:` entry, shown on the course page and the unit's first lesson.
  - **Lesson hook (sparingly):** only where the Predict depends on seeing something move or fail. Optional, on the Predict step. Many Predicts already hook; don't add filler.
  - Recorded from a board or playground setup with the existing clip pipeline, so cost is low. Avoid real footage (licences, school filters).
- **How-to clips: their own section, like Reference.** Short screen recordings of tool setup that is a recipe, not the lesson's knowledge: export a Teachable Machine model, connect a micro:bit over Web Serial, paste a link into the board, open MakeCode full screen.
  - One place per subject or pathway (beside Reference). A step links to the clip at the point of need ("How to: …").
  - Reused across courses (record "Connect a micro:bit" once).
  - Dated, with the tool version, so stale ones are easy to find when a tool's interface changes.
  - Prepare lists the how-tos a lesson needs, so teachers can rehearse the setup.
- **Recap: no new clip type.** Practise already does recap as retrieval. Instead, a review question (one revisiting an earlier lesson's idea) can point back to where the idea was taught:
  - A `revisit: <lesson slug>` field on the check. After a wrong answer (or two), the page shows "Revisit: <lesson title>", which opens that lesson with its Explain drawer already open (`?explain=1` on lesson pages).
  - Validate checks that the slug exists and comes earlier (same rule as `assumes`).
  - Not plain links in feedback: feedback is rendered as plain text (`textContent`, `plain()` in `lesson-view.mjs`).
  - Build it with the first Practise step that has review questions; document in AUTHORING.md only once built.
- **Open:** format for `hook:` (clip spec as for `explainClip`, or a board setup); where the How-to section lives (per pathway or per subject); whether how-tos are recorded by `render.mjs` or by hand (real tools such as Teachable Machine can't be driven from the sandbox).
- Answer forms `simplest` (fraction in lowest terms) and `decimal` in `tools/maths-forms.mjs` (no Numbas needed for them) and the form lists in `tools/lesson-core.mjs`; answer checks (`tools/lesson-view.mjs`) ignore a trailing % or °. New maths board widget `widgets/bars.js` (script tag in `playground-board/index.html`).
- Board (maths widgets): graph gains `plot: x = a` and `shade:` regions; numberline gains `ray:` (inequalities).
- New maths board widgets `widgets/data.js` (dot plots, stem-and-leaf, statistics) and `widgets/chance.js` (coin, dice, spinner, bag; trials and relative frequency), with script tags in `playground-board/index.html` and styles in `style.css`. New tool `tools/kit-page.mjs` writes progression pages from a waypoints-kit checkout (for the node check), noted in `data/progressions/README.md`; the map's importer (`tools/import-curriculum.mjs`) is unchanged.
- New maths board widgets (maths chat, 11 Oct): `widgets/square.js` (squares and roots), `factortree.js` (factor trees, HCF and LCM), `fracadd.js` (adding and subtracting fractions), `fracarea.js` (multiplying fractions) and `percent.js` (percentages of amounts), with script tags in `playground-board/index.html` and two `.ftpick` rules in `style.css`. No change to `core.js` or other widgets.
- New maths board widgets (maths chat, 11 Oct): `widgets/area.js` (parallelograms and triangles on a grid, cut and move), `prism.js` (prisms in layers, SVG) and `circle.js` (parts of a circle, roll it out for π), with script tags in `playground-board/index.html`. `square.js`, `fracarea.js` and `fracadd.js` gained `resize` (redraw on window resize). No change to `core.js`.
- Maths boards, Number (maths chat, 11 Oct): new `widgets/placevalue.js`, `widgets/rounding.js` (`mode: round | estimate`) and `widgets/ratio.js` (`mode: tape | share`), script tags in `playground-board/index.html`, `.pv*` styles in `style.css`. No existing widget changed. Board `when:` variables must be single letters (the expression evaluator multiplies adjacent letters). Every board widget needs an `#board svg` for `render-pictures` to wait on (placevalue draws counters in SVG for that reason).
- Number checks show `feedback` (maths chat, 12 Oct): `["wrong number", "message"]` pairs on a `number` check were ignored (34 pairs across maths never showed). `lesson-view.mjs` now outputs them and matches the typed number within the tolerance; `lesson-core.mjs` validates the pairs. No content changed.
- Maths board, Year 8 Statistics (maths chat, 12 Oct): new `widgets/sample.js` (a fixed school of 200 and samples from it), script tag in `playground-board/index.html`. No change to `core.js` or other widgets.
- Maths boards, Year 8 Chance (maths chat, 12 Oct): new `widgets/events.js` (sample spaces as a row, grid or tree; choose outcomes, complement, simulated trials) and `widgets/venn.js` (Venn diagram and two-way table), script tags in `playground-board/index.html`, a `.vn*`/`.evcell` block at the end of `style.css`. No change to `core.js` or other widgets.
- Maths boards, Year 8 Space (maths chat, 12 Oct): new `widgets/congruence.js` (triangles from given parts; SSA can give two), `widgets/similar.js` (a triangle and a scaled copy, or two rectangles) and `widgets/space3d.js` (3D axes and a point), script tags in `playground-board/index.html`. `widgets/geometry.js` gains `diagonals: on` (off by default, so existing lessons are unchanged). No change to `core.js`.
- Maths board, Year 8 Rates (maths chat, 12 Oct): new `widgets/rate.js` (a double number line), script tag in `playground-board/index.html`. No change to `core.js` or other widgets.
- Sources in teacher notes (maths chat, 12 Oct, Matthew approved): `teacher.yml` takes `sources:` (title, https url, checked YYYY-MM-DD), checked by `validateTeacher` in `lesson-core.mjs` (`sourceList` formats it) and shown as Sources in For teachers (`lesson-view.mjs`), the teacher guide (`teach.mjs`) and the title slide's speaker note. First used by maths/number/money-models and maths/measurement/time-zones. Other subjects can use it for facts that change.
- Maths boards, Year 8 Number (maths chat, 12 Oct): new `widgets/longdiv.js`, `zoomline.js`, `indexlaws.js` and `money.js`, script tags in `playground-board/index.html`. No change to `core.js` or other widgets. New course folder `content/maths/real-numbers/` (the pathway's "Irrational numbers and index laws" placeholder, now built) with `snippets/maths-real.json`.
- Maths boards, Year 8 Measurement (maths chat, 11 Oct): new `widgets/composite.js` (`mode: shape | estimate`), `widgets/circlearea.js` and `widgets/timezone.js`, script tags in `playground-board/index.html`; the prism board's `capacity: on` also takes `units: m` (litres). No change to `core.js` or other widgets.
- Maths boards, Space (maths chat, 11 Oct): new `widgets/transform.js` (`mode: translate | reflect | rotate`), `widgets/net.js` (`mode: cube | prism`) and `widgets/views.js`, script tags in `playground-board/index.html`, `.vgrid` / `.vcell` rules at the end of `style.css`. The SVG widgets (net, views, and now ratio and rounding) are absolutely positioned inside `#board` (`height: 100%`) so they fit the flex board. No change to `core.js` or other widgets; the classification algorithm lesson reuses the `key` widget.
- Maths boards (maths chat, 11 Oct): `widgets/geometry.js` gains `classify: on` (ticks, parallel arrows, right-angle marks and shape names; existing lessons unchanged, as it is off by default); new `widgets/pythag.js` (squares on the sides, an angle slider), script tag in `playground-board/index.html`.

## Done (11 Oct 2026): trail map on Code pathway pages

Pathway pages open on a trail map for students, with a "List for teachers" toggle. Code only (`trail: true` in `content/code/index.md`); maths and science pathway pages are unchanged. Mockup and discussion: the "Trail map mockup" canvas.

- **Shared files changed:** `tools/build-site.mjs` (pathway page: map, toggle, `tagline` on cards, warns when a course has no tagline; only when the subject has `trail: true`), `tools/lesson-view.mjs` (one rule: `.pcard .ptag`). New: `tools/trail.mjs` (layout and CSS), `site/trail.js` (copied to `dist/trail.js`).
- **Layout** from `after:`: a column per step along the trail, rows lining a course up with what it follows. An extension with no `after:` follows the foundations. A prerequisite in another pathway (Flask needs HTML & CSS) is a portal node linking to that pathway.
- **Progress** from `wp-progress` through `progress.js`: done, in progress (n/m), not started, coming later. "You are here" is the course of the last lesson opened, else one in progress; otherwise "Next stop" or "Start here". Hover or focus previews a course in the card; Continue opens the next unfinished lesson. On phones the map is a list with "After …" lines and the taglines.
- **Content:** every Code course has a student `tagline:` (drafts; Matthew to adjust wording).
- **Tested** headless at 1280 and 390 px, light and dark, no progress and seeded progress, keyboard focus, list remembered, list shown without JavaScript.

**Next:** Things you've made (proposed, not built): a gallery of each student's Make outputs, grouped by course on the pathway page (latest few plus "All n"), the full set on the course page, one starred favourite. Needs a snapshot per playground (turtle canvas, HTML preview, MakeCode simulator) saved per browser.

**Maths and science: to plan before turning the map on** (`trail: true`):
- Is a pathway a trail there? Maths courses follow the curriculum's year order and the progression data's `prior_knowledge`; the map could use those links instead of hand-written `after:`, which would make it much denser.
- What is a waypoint: a course, a unit, or a progression node? Science "courses" are year-level sets of concept tutorials (a side tool, not a whole course), so a map may not fit at all.
- Cross-subject links (the winch needs maths ratio and science forces) could be portal nodes, as Code does across pathways.
- Taglines for every maths and science course.
- Home page (`content/index.md`): a "Maths teachers: start here" link after the maths paragraph, to the new plain page `/maths-teachers/`.

## Done (11 Oct 2026): curriculum map for maths (preview for maths teachers)

`/maths/map/` (and "Curriculum map" in the Maths menu, and a card on the Maths page): all 101 Years 7–10 descriptors in a grid of strands by years, plus the 22 earlier-year descriptors they build on. Each tile shows its waypoints (done, has a lesson, no lesson yet, from lessons' `node:`). Hover or focus previews a descriptor in the card (descriptor text, waypoints with their lessons and courses, hinge marks, builds on and leads to); click chooses it and puts `#AC9M8A02` in the address to share. Lines show builds on (solid blue) and leads to (dashed teal) for the one in focus only. "With lessons" dims the rest. Phones: one list per strand, card first, no lines.

- **Data:** `data/curriculum/maths.json`, made by `node tools/import-curriculum.mjs <waypoints-kit checkout> maths` from waypoints-kit (now at cggs-matthew-pham/waypoints-kit, public) and committed, so the build never needs the kit. Titles: the progression page's where one exists, else the kit's in sentence case. `data/progressions/` (the node check) is unchanged.
- **Shared files changed:** `tools/build-site.mjs` (map page when the subject's index.md has `map: true` and the data exists; menu item; Maths page card), `tools/lesson-view.mjs` (one rule: `.pcard.pmap`). New: `tools/curriculum-map.mjs`, `site/curriculum-map.js`, `tools/import-curriculum.mjs`.
- **Questions for the maths teachers:** is the grid the right overview, or would a list by strand be quicker? Is a "usually taught" layer (term or school program) worth adding beside the builds-on lines? Which descriptors most need lessons next? Should students see this, or the course trails?
- **Science: built, switched off (11 Oct).** `data/curriculum/science.json` (51 Years 7–10 descriptors and 22 earlier ones). Rows: Biological, Chemical, Earth and space, Physical, Human endeavour, Inquiry. Human endeavour and Inquiry are written for two years at a time (7H, 7I = Years 7–8; 9H, 9I = Years 9–10), so their cells span two columns. The kit labels Year 7 Understanding descriptors only "Understanding" with no prior knowledge (except 7U06); the importer takes their sub-strand from the code, but their links back to Years 5–6 need fixing in the kit.
- **Handoff to the science chat:** tag each science lesson with the node it teaches (`node: AC9S7U04 n2`, as maths lessons do; the topic list in CLAUDE.md › Science gives most of them), then add `map: true` to `content/science/index.md`. Until the tags are in, every science tile shows "no lesson yet", which is why it is off. Adding `science` to `CHECKED` in `tools/progressions.mjs` is a separate choice (it makes validate require a node on every science lesson).

## Done (11 Oct 2026): trailheads on the Code page

With `trail: true`, `/code/` opens on trailheads: a Continue card (the course of the last lesson opened, else one in progress, linking to its next unfinished lesson), then one card per pathway with its summary, a small picture of its trail (dots and lines from the same layout as the pathway map, marked done, in progress and "you are here"), a "Start here…" line (new `fit:` on each pathway in `code/index.md`), "n of m courses done", and a link to its trail. "List for teachers" holds the old page and shares the `wp-pathview` choice with the pathway pages. Shared files: `tools/build-site.mjs` (subject page), `tools/trail.mjs` (`trailThumb`, `trailheadsHtml`, `TRAILHEADS_CSS`); new `site/trailheads.js`. Maths and science pages are unchanged until they set `trail: true` (their pathways would need `fit:` and course taglines).

## Done (11 Oct 2026): science trails

`/science/` now opens on trailheads and each science pathway page on a trail map, like Code (`trail: true`, `fit:` per pathway, a `tagline:` per course in `content/science/index.md`). Each pathway runs Year 7 → 8 → 9 → 10 through `after:`; Year 9 Physics also follows Year 7 Chemistry (heat transfer uses the particle model), shown as a portal. The curriculum map stays for teachers and curious students: on a subject with trails its card now sits below the trailheads instead of above them (`tools/build-site.mjs`, one line; Maths unchanged). Tested headless at 1280 and 390 px, no page errors, no sideways scroll. Maths followed the same day: `trail: true`, `fit:` and taglines in `content/maths/index.md` (its existing `after:` lines drive the layout; Number Foundations is a portal on the other three trails). `tools/trail.mjs` now accepts a course's `id:` in `after:` as well as its path (maths uses ids).

## Done (11 Oct 2026): science trail stops are standards

`trail: units` in a subject's index.md (science) makes each unit of a course a stop, named by the unit (one standard each in science: Particle theory, Pure substances and mixtures, ...), with the course's year in the stop's small line ("Year 8 · 5 lessons"). Units chain within a course; a course's first unit follows the last unit of what it comes after. `after:` may name one unit of another pathway's course (`science/chemistry#particles`), shown as a portal with the unit's name and in the teacher list as "Year 7 Chemistry (Particle theory)". Progress, "You are here" and Continue count the unit's lessons only (`unit` added to `progress-manifest.json` lessons and passed through `progress.js`); stops link to `#unit-<id>` on the course page (unit sections now have that id). Narrower columns for unit trails so eight stops fit at 1080 px; on phones the indent stops growing after two steps. Maths uses it too (same day); Code keeps one stop per course (`trail: true`). A stop's small line shows the course's year only when the course title starts with one (science); maths shows just the lesson count. Shared files: `tools/trail.mjs`, `tools/build-site.mjs`, `site/trail.js`, `site/trailheads.js`, `site/progress.js`.

## Proposed (11 Oct 2026, branch trail-expand): open one course at a time on the trail

Pathway pages of subjects with `trail: units` (Code too, on this branch) show one stop per course, laid out as the course trail; a course with two or more units opens into an area headed by its name, its units as stops snaking inside (up to three to a row, ending on the right so the trail leaves it cleanly). The current course opens on its own (else the first); clicking another course opens it and closes the one that was open; a unit stop goes to that unit on the course page. Trailhead pictures on subject pages are back to one dot per course. Shared files: `tools/trail.mjs` (`layoutTrailExpand`, area HTML and CSS), `site/trail.js` (rewritten: unit progress, open/close, lines in any direction), `tools/build-site.mjs`.

## Done (11 Oct 2026): recap page (Year 7 Chemistry first)

`recap: true` in a course's index.md makes `<course>/recap/` (a Recap chip on the course page): required lessons grouped by unit, each a card with the lesson's exit question as "Try first" and a closed "Check your answer" holding the exit answer, the Explain-it-to-me text, its picture and its clip (`preload="none"`, files read from the lesson's own `clips/`). A lesson with no exit question shows "Show the explanation" instead. Nothing new to write: it reuses `teacher.yml` (`exit`, `explain`) and the lesson's `explainPicture` and `explainClip`. On for `science/chemistry` only; turn it on per course. Shared file: `tools/build-site.mjs` (`writeRecap`, `RECAP_CSS`).

## Done (12 Oct 2026, shared-tools chat): a choice of voices for clips, and the recorder lag

Built together (both edit `render.mjs`, so one full re-record at the next publish, not two), from the proposal below and the maths and science notes under it.

- **Recorder lag fixed.** `render.mjs` no longer uses Playwright's `recordVideo`: it takes Chromium's screencast frames (CDP `Page.startScreencast`), saves each with the time it was drawn, and builds the clip from those times (ffmpeg concat at 25 fps), so a busy board that drops frames keeps step with the voice. Encoding happens once after recording, which also frees the CPU during it. Measured in the sandbox with flite: igneous captions now land within 0.1 s of their voice lines, also with every core busy (the old recorder was a steady 0.9 s out here, and about 15 s in CI). x264 `crf` 24 → 27: frames are now sharp (the old source was a blurry webm), so busy boards stay near their old size (plates 3.4 MB at 24, about 1.8 MB at 27, was 1.3 MB); light clips are smaller than before. The igneous explain clip is back (`content/science/earth-8/igneous/lesson.md`, unchanged from before its removal).
- **Voices.** `CLIP_VOICES` (Emma, George, Heart) and `VOICE_LABELS` in `tools/lesson-core.mjs`. Every line is made in all three at the lesson's speed. The lesson's own voice is mixed into `clips/<id>.mp4` as before (so the default needs no syncing, a download is not silent, and a script failure still talks); each other voice is `clips/<id>.<voice>.m4a`, as long as the video, listed in `clips/<id>.json` as `voices`. `--seed` and the out-of-time fallback download them too. The voice set is in the clip hash.
- **Timing.** Captions wait for the slowest voice (as planned). The first click, press or run after a caption waits until every voice has finished that line (science's suggestion). Code typed after a caption (`show`, `type`, `clear`) moves only by how much longer the slowest voice takes: holding typing for the whole line made HTML clips about 11 s longer (first-page Investigate 25 → 37 s) and broke "type as the caption explains it". Change the one `if` in `recordClip` if every action should wait.
- **Page.** `clipHtml` (`build-site.mjs`) adds `data-voice`/`data-voices` and a "Voice: Emma · George · Heart" picker; `VOICE_JS` and `.vpick` styles in `lesson-view.mjs` (the script is added only to pages with a multi-voice clip; recap pages get it too). The choice is saved as `wp-voice` and applies to every clip. Another voice plays as an `Audio` kept in step with the video: play, pause, waiting, seek, rate, every loop (restart when `currentTime` jumps back), drift over 0.3 s corrected on `timeupdate`. The video's own voice is silenced through a Web Audio gain where the browser allows a video's volume to be set (so the sound button still works as usual); on iPhone and iPad (volume is read-only) the video stays muted and each press of its sound button turns the chosen voice on or off, said in the note beside the picker. A voice file that fails to load falls back to the lesson's voice.
- **Checks.** `build-site` refuses any `.m4a` whose clip record says flite or is missing. `voice.mjs`: flite uses a different voice for George (`rms`) and Heart (`awb`), so local tests show the slowest-voice timing. `tools/serve.mjs` serves `.m4a`. Render warns on clips over 30 s in their slowest voice and lists them at the end of the log and in the publish run's summary.
- **Tested** (headless Chromium, 390 × 844 touch viewport; this Chromium has no H.264 or AAC, so the test served VP8/Opus copies of the same clips): picker shown, choice saved and restored after reload; with the chosen voice and sound on, the voice file plays within 0.15 s of the video after play, seek, rate 1.5 and a loop; pause and mute stop it; switching back to the lesson's voice stops it; the iPhone path (volume read-only) toggles on each sound press. Clips recorded with flite: igneous, plates, turtle intro, HTML first page, irrationals on the line.
- **Cost at the next publish:** every clip re-records, and every spoken line is made in two more voices (Kokoro, a few seconds each; cached afterwards in `.voice-cache`). Use 8 jobs in the Run workflow form for that run. A Safari check on a real phone is still worth doing after the publish.
- **Still to do:** after the first publish, list the clips over 30 s in their slowest voice (run summary) for the subject chats to trim.

## Done (12 Oct 2026, shared-tools chat): one bad picture no longer fails the publish

The publish run on 3a177f1 failed in the plan job's "Draw new pictures": the Digital systems `decode` and `pixels` boards draw plain HTML, and `drawBoard` waited for `#board svg` (or `canvas.wpcv`), so their explain pictures timed out and the whole step stopped.
- `tools/render-pictures.mjs`: a picture that throws is reported (`✗`), skipped and drawn again next run; it keeps its old picture if it had one. The run ends normally and lists skipped pictures in the log, the run summary and a warning annotation.
- `drawBoard` also accepts any board content (`#board > *`), so plain-HTML widgets need no hidden svg. This changes the board and maths pictures' hash: all of them redraw at the next publish (227 board pictures took about 4 minutes here), alongside the full clip re-record that publish already does.
- For the Digital systems chat: the run-length explain picture is cropped through its last code line (`1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,`); the board is wider than the picture's 680 px viewport.

## Done (12 Oct 2026, maths chat; Matthew approved): shuffle question options at build time

The right answer is the first option in most `question` checks: 335 of 353 in maths, 455 of 471 in science, 190 of 288 in code, all 21 in systems (and nearly every `predict`). Students learn to pick the first option. `lesson-view.mjs` prints options in authored order. Proposal: a seeded shuffle at build time (seed from the lesson slug and the question text, so it is stable between builds and the same on the page, the teacher guide, the deck and the worksheet), remapping `answer` and per-option `feedback`; `predict` options shuffled the same way. Authors keep writing the right answer first. Test harnesses that click an option by index would read the remapped `answer`. The Year 8 Chance lessons were rotated by hand first.

Built: `arrangeOptions` in `tools/lesson-core.mjs`, called from `parseLessonText` for every step and task check, so the page, `teach.mjs` (guides, decks, worksheets), `check-html` and the create page all see the same order. Seeded by slug, question and options (FNV hash into mulberry32); options that are all numbers or fractions are sorted; catch-alls (None of them, Neither, You cannot tell, It depends) stay last; `shuffle: false` opts out; `authoredAnswer` keeps the original index. Across 1259 question checks the answer now lands evenly (first option about a third of three-option and a quarter of four-option questions). Clips are unaffected (they record boards and code, not checks). For other chats: a test plan that clicks an option by its authored index must read the parsed `answer` instead (`check-html` already does). Students who already answered keep their ticks (progress is stored by check, not option).

## Done (12 Oct 2026, maths chat): practice choices, scenario banks and the board
- `practice-core.mjs`: `choices:`, `cases:`, `board:` (+ `height:`) and `when:`; `practice-view.mjs` shows choice buttons and one board iframe per page (`set-code` for each question; `when` is checked against its last `run` message, and needs the student to have moved it). `build-site` passes the board's address (`VERSIONS`). `tools/check-practice.mjs` (`npm run check-practice`): every board setup starts, and every `when` uses reported values and does not hold at the start. Usable by any subject with practice files.

## Done (12 Oct 2026, maths chat): Practise this skill card on lesson pages
- `build-site` passes `course.practice` (`../practice/?skill=<lesson>`) when `content/<course>/practice/<lesson>.yml` exists; `lesson-view` draws a `.practicecard` (a `.nextcard`) after Now you can. Any subject that adds practice files gets it; no clips change.

## Done (12 Oct 2026, maths chat): Practice pages take algebra; fully factorised fix
- `tools/practice-core.mjs`: expression answers, `form: expanded | factorised | simplified` (Numbas, loaded on the practice page only when used; marks by value alone if it has not loaded after 10 s), `subject x`, inequality answers, `|c`/`|sc` coefficient filters, a `keep` flag on form slips (the streak is kept), typed ² and ³, "Use the letter n".
- `tools/maths-forms.mjs` (shared with lesson answer checks): "fully factorised" now takes the HCF of the bracket's whole-number coefficients. Numbas's collectIntegerFactors also grouped any two terms sharing a factor, so 3(2x + y + 2) was wrongly told to take out a common factor. Cases added to `data/forms-cases.json`.

## Done (12 Oct 2026, maths chat; Matthew asked): a Practice page with new numbers each time

Like 101computing's logic-gate practice: a check is a template whose numbers change each view. `vars: { r: 2..9, b: 2..9 }`, `where: "r != b"`, `{r}` in the question, `answer: "r/(r+b)"` (an expression, marked with the existing maths equivalence checker), feedback answers as expressions too. A **New question** button; optionally `need: 3` (3 right in a row to tick). Decks and worksheets print one fixed seed so the answer key matches. Validate tries each template a few hundred times (no division by zero, constraints satisfiable, tidy answers). Board generators fit the same idea later (a random logic circuit for a truth table, random triangle parts, a random sample space). First: number and answer checks, trialled on the Practise steps of a few Year 8 maths lessons. Shared files: `lesson-core.mjs` (template fields, validation), `lesson-view.mjs` (generate and mark), `teach.mjs` (fixed instance).

Built as a course page rather than in lessons (lessons keep their chosen numbers): `tools/practice-core.mjs` (templates, generation, marking; inlined in the page like MATH_JS and used by validate), `tools/practice-view.mjs` (page UI and CSS), `build-site.mjs` (`practiceSkills`, `writePractice`, a Practice chip when `content/<course>/practice/` exists), `validate.mjs` (300 questions per template; errors for broken or self-failing answers). Files sit in `content/<course>/practice/`, outside lesson folders, so no clip re-records. Any subject can use it (science's numeric skills, the Digital systems chat's logic practice once a board generator exists). First course: Number Foundations (29 skills; Checking a model has none, as naming assumptions isn't auto-markable).

## Proposed (12 Oct 2026, code chat; Matthew agreed the idea): a choice of voices for clips (built: see Done above)

**Why:** students choose the voice they like best for Explain it to me clips. Today each lesson names one voice: code uses Heart (US), maths and science use Emma (UK) at 1.05.

**How:** the video is recorded once and each voice gets its own audio file, so recording time does not grow with the number of voices.
- **`render.mjs`:**
  - Already makes every spoken line before it records (`lineFor`, with each line's length).
  - It would make each line in every voice and time the clip by the longest one. The next caption waits for the slowest voice, so the faster voices have a slightly longer pause after their line.
  - It would then write a silent `clips/<id>.mp4`, plus `clips/<id>.<voice>.m4a` for each voice, built the same way `muxVoice` builds today's mixed audio.
  - The `.vtt` transcript stays as it is: the words are the same for every voice.
- **Lesson page (`clipHtml` in `build-site.mjs`, plus a little script in `lesson-view.mjs`):**
  - The video stays muted, and a hidden audio element plays the chosen voice in step with it (play, pause, seek, loop, rate).
  - A small "Voice: Emma · George · Heart" picker sits under voiced clips. The choice is saved per browser (`wp-voice`) and applies to every clip on the site.
  - Unmuting the video's own button turns the voice on, as now.
- **Why not one file with several audio tracks:** most browsers can't switch audio tracks inside a video, Chrome included. Separate files work everywhere.
- **Voices:** Emma (`bf_emma`, UK woman), George (`bm_george`, UK man) and Heart (`af_heart`, US woman); the default is Emma. Kokoro has no Australian voice.
  - A lesson's `voice:` keeps its speed, and its name sets the voice students hear until they choose one.
  - `say:` lines are shared by all three voices.
- **Cost:**
  - Changing `render.mjs` re-records every voiced clip once at the next publish, about the same time as a normal full re-record.
  - After that, speech is a few seconds per voice per clip, and three audio files add about 100 to 300 KB per clip.
  - Lines must still fit the slowest voice in under about 30 s.
- **Checks:**
  - `build-site` refuses flite audio files, as it refuses flite clips today.
  - A clip with a missing voice file falls back to the lesson's default voice.
  - Test the sync on a phone, where Safari is strict about autoplay.
- **To agree with the maths and science chats:** Emma as the default, and the three-voice set.
- **Maths chat (12 Oct): agreed**, Emma as default and the three voices. Maths say: lines are already written as spoken words ("root two", "one point four"), and the lexicon is plain text swaps, so they suit all three voices. Suggestions:
  - Keep the lesson's default voice muxed into `clips/<id>.mp4` (as today) and add `.m4a` files only for the other voices. The default then needs no syncing, a missing file or a script failure still talks, and a downloaded or directly linked clip is not silent. Choosing another voice mutes the video's own track and plays its `.m4a`.
  - Clips loop (`loop` on every clip): restart the `.m4a` on each loop, not only on seek.
  - Validate's 15-word guide stays; time each caption by the slowest voice as planned (maths explain clips are 12 to 25 s, so the extra pause is small).

- **Science chat (12 Oct): agreed**, Emma as default and the three voices (all 103 science lessons use Emma at 1.05, so nothing changes for students who never pick). Agree with maths: keep the default voice muxed into the `.mp4`. Suggestions:
  - **Pictures shouldn't run ahead of a slower voice.** Science clips use a fixed `wait:` after each caption (tuned by ear to Emma), then click the board. With George a little slower, the board would move on while he is still describing the step before. Suggest: in multi-voice recording, the first action after a caption waits until the slowest voice has finished that line (as `speak()` already does for the next caption). That lengthens clips slightly and keeps words and pictures together in every voice; then most hand-tuned `wait:` values can stay.
  - **Fix the busy-board lag in the same change.** Both edit `render.mjs`, and each edit re-records every clip, so doing the recorder lag (Open, above) together costs one full re-record, not two, and brings back the igneous clip.
  - **Check length with the slowest voice.** Some science clips run near or over the 30 s guide with Emma; after the first multi-voice publish, list clips over 30 s in their slowest voice and trim those `say:` lines.

## Proposed (12 Oct 2026, science chat; Matthew agreed the idea): a one-move coach prompt on recap pages

**Why:** responsible AI use, aimed at beneficial rather than detrimental offloading. Lodge and Loble, *Artificial intelligence, cognitive offloading and implications for education* (UTS, March 2026; https://www.uts.edu.au/news/2026/03/experts-warn-unstructured-ai-use-in-schools-risks-cognitive-atrophy/contentassets/ai-cognitive-offloading-and-implications-for-education.pdf): offloading extraneous load can help, offloading the thinking that builds learning harms it, unstructured use drifts to the harmful kind and novices are hit hardest. It recommends metacognitive prompts, critical thinking within domain knowledge, teacher agency over AI tools, and favours teacher-facing AI.

**What:** a "Copy a coach prompt" button, not a built-in chatbot. The site sends nothing and needs no accounts or keys; the student pastes the prompt into the AI tool the school allows (age terms and policy stay with the school).
- **Scoped to one move:** the lesson's node sentence (the exact idea, not the topic), its success criteria, the misconceptions behind its wrong options, and its predict question.
- **Coaching rules in the prompt:** Socratic, one question at a time, never give the answer; probe the named misconception; may check the one prerequisite node the progression data names (one step back), never later ideas; redirect anything else ("that's for another lesson"); stop when the student explains the move in their own words and gets one new case right, then send them back to the lesson.
- **Limits stated plainly:** a prompt instructs, it can't enforce; it makes the coached path the default.

**Where (low prominence for now):**
- **Recap page only** (`recapHtml` in `build-site.mjs`): a small "Still stuck? Copy a coach prompt" under each answer, after the student has tried. Not on lesson pages, so the board and checks stay the main path.
- **Teacher guide:** the same prompt per lesson, so teachers see exactly what it says.
- Off unless the course or teacher turns it on (a course flag, or `?coach=1` on the recap link, as `?width=` works).
- Generated at build time from existing data (no AI at build); applies to any subject with nodes and misconceptions (maths and science first; code later).

**Later, if it works:** move into lessons after two wrong attempts; relates to the parked Nib idea (protégé effect, also named in the paper).

**To agree with the code and maths chats:** placement (recap and teacher guide), the default (off), and the prompt rules.

**Built for science (12 Oct, Matthew asked):** `tools/coach.mjs` (new) builds the prompt from the node's title, statement and success criteria, the node before it, and the first three `stuck:` lines. A course opts in with `coach: true` in its `index.md` (all 15 science courses; no other course changes). `tools/build-site.mjs`: prompts computed for opted-in courses; the recap card gets a hidden "Still stuck?" box with Copy (`.rccoach`, `RECAP_COACH_JS`), shown only when the recap URL has `?coach=1`. `tools/teach.mjs`: a "Coach prompt (optional)" section in the lesson guide with the full prompt and the `?coach=1` recap link. Maths or code can opt in by adding `coach: true` once they agree.

## Made (12 Oct 2026, code chat): 10K02 practice in HTML & CSS

The systems chat tagged the lessons, built How a web page is made and the theory concepts (see the systems entry below). On top of that, two checks so students who take only HTML & CSS still practise 10K02. Only lesson.md changed, so no clip re-records:
- Rules and selectors: a last Investigate task that sorts parts of a page into content, structure and presentation (n1).
- Page sections: a question on one style sheet restyling 40 pages, and screen readers reading the structure (n3's reasons). The node tags stay as the systems chat set them.

## Made (12 Oct 2026, code chat): open projects (Matthew asked to build)

Shared files touched; nothing re-records except the four lessons whose exit question changed and DOM clips (dom-errors hint):
- `tools/concepts.mjs` is split: the pure table and `conceptsIn` moved to `tools/concepts-core.mjs` (re-exported, no behaviour change; `check-concepts` passes), which the build copies to `dist/concepts-core.js`.
- `tools/build-site.mjs`: `writeProjects` (pages, chip, script), a projects section in the course teacher guide, recap cards get `id="<lesson>"` so links can land on one.
- `tools/trail.mjs` and `site/trail.js`: `trailHtml(layout, up, esc, { projects })` marks a course stop with its briefs and the card offers "◆ n projects to build" (units offer their course's).
- `tools/render-pictures.mjs`: a new `projects` section (only its own pictures draw).
- `tools/validate.mjs`: checks briefs. `tools/build-playground.mjs`: copies `web-helpers/` into the HTML and DOM playgrounds' `media/`.
- New: `tools/projects.mjs`, `tools/project-view.mjs`, `site/project.js`, `web-helpers/microbit.js`.
Maths and science can add `projects.yml` to a course if useful; `uses` needs concepts in `concepts-core` for their language, so for now it suits code courses.

## Made (12 Oct 2026, code chat): shared changes for the web pathway after the DOM

Proposed first, then made in the same batch, as Matthew asked for the courses to be built. Status per line: made with Bootstrap unless marked later.

For the four web proposals in `roadmap/code.md` (Bootstrap, Vue, the three-framework lesson, JavaScript `fetch`). Matthew asked for them to be built; these are the shared-tool changes they need, kept small. Nothing here changes a maths or science file.
- **`vendor/web/` (new):** Bootstrap 5.3.8 CSS, Vue 3.5.43 (global development build, for its warnings), Preact 11 with htm as one script, and Svelte 5.57.2's compiler and runtime with a small glue script (`svelte-glue.js`, ours). Licences beside them; `make.mjs` rebuilds them from npm. No CDN at run time.
- **`tools/build-playground.mjs`:** `buildHtmlPlayground` also copies `vendor/web/*` into `_playground-html/media/`; `buildDomPlayground` copies `media/html/` and `vendor/web/*` into `_playground-dom/media/`. A page then loads a library as a file beside it (`<script src="vue.js">`), in the playground, in pictures and in clips. `hashDir('media')` in `render-pictures` reads the source `media/` folder, so no existing picture redraws because of the copies.
- **`tools/serve.mjs` and the server in `tools/render-pictures.mjs`:** send `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`, as GitHub Pages does, so `fetch("weather.json")` from a sandboxed preview works in clips and pictures as it does on the site. No section hash changes (the server is outside them).
- **`tools/build-site.mjs`:** `PLAY` entries for `code/bootstrap` (HTML playground) and `code/vue` (DOM playground); `REFS` pages for `code/bootstrap`, `code/vue` and `code/dom` (groups of `snippets/html.json`).
- **`tools/concepts.mjs`:** `CONCEPTS.html` gains Bootstrap, Vue and `fetch` concepts, so the hidden-assumptions lint covers the new lessons.
- **`misconceptions.json`:** entries with homes in the new lessons. The voice lexicon is left alone (editing it re-records every voiced clip on the site): spoken lines spell awkward names in `say:` instead ("view" for Vue).
- **Clips and pictures:** `snippets/html.json` gains Bootstrap, Vue, Frameworks and Fetch groups, and `playground-dom/` changes (below), so every HTML and DOM clip records again at the next publish (as when turtle.json grew). New cards get new pictures; existing pictures keep their hashes.
- **`vendor/web/` also has** Bulma, Pico (classless), Tailwind's browser build and daisyUI, for the Bootstrap course's look at other frameworks (Matthew asked for it).
- **`tools/check-html-lessons.mjs`:** also walks `code/bootstrap/`, and answers `sort` checks the way it answers `match` (no existing lesson's result changed).
- **`tools/render-pictures.mjs` (with Vue):** the html and expected sections load each page from the local server's address (`showPage`) instead of `setContent`, which writes the page with `document.write`, so Chromium blocked its `<script src>` lines and Vue pages drew `{{ }}` unfilled. Their hashes change, so the 56 HTML card pictures and 98 expected pictures redraw once (quick; no MakeCode, no `SHARED` bump).
- **`tools/check-html-lessons.mjs` (with Vue):** also walks `code/dom/` and `code/vue/`; on the DOM playground it presses Run after putting in a solution. All DOM lessons pass.
- **Svelte wrapper:** a component sits in `<textarea data-svelte hidden>` (not a `<script>` with a comment), so code checks and the concept scan see it.
- **`media/html/weather.json` (with fetch):** the saved Canberra forecast, so `fetch("weather.json")` works beside the page. `hashDir('media')` changes, so the HTML-playground `shown` pictures redraw once too.
- **For Your site, for real and Saving between visits (12 Oct):** `tools/build-site.mjs` `PLAY` and `REFS` for `code/site`; `tools/concepts.mjs` gains `local-storage`; `tools/build-playground.mjs` copies `playground-html/download.js` into `_playground-dom/`; `tools/check-html-lessons.mjs` walks `code/site/`, accepts planted paths from one computer as broken pictures, and retries a Run that did not report. `snippets/html.json` gains the "A page for everyone, online" cards (alt text, heading outline, whole page, relative path): they match ordinary HTML, so the HTML course's cheat sheets list them too (they are unlocked in the site lessons).
- **Code chat's own files (for the record):** `playground-dom/main.js` gives the preview `<base href="media/">` (as the HTML playground does), makes `#name` links scroll inside the page, shows an `Error` in `console.log` by its message, gives a line number only for errors in the page itself (not in a library), and loads `<script src>` files beside the page with `crossorigin` (same line) so a library's rethrown error shows its real message, not "Script error.". `playground-dom/dom-errors.js`: hints for a Vue ref changed without `.value`, for a missing library line, for a promise used without `await` and for text that is not JSON. Later the same day: a **Download** button in both playgrounds; the DOM preview gets a `localStorage` stand-in kept per step by the playground, and the HTML preview an in-memory one (the sandboxed previews have no storage of their own).

## Parked

- Custom domain setup (DNS and the Pages setting are on Matthew's side).
- Progress export and import (a short copy-and-paste code to move progress between browsers) and a printable certificate of current progress. A fun long-term idea; keep it account-free.

## Changed by the science chat (11 Oct 2026)

- New shared-board widget `playground-board/widgets/energy.js` (Matthew approved): `mode: coaster | chain | sankey` for Year 8 and 9 energy. One `<script>` line in `playground-board/index.html` and a few `.en*` rules at the end of `style.css`; nothing existing changed (AUTHORING › 12). As with any board change, board clips and pictures re-record and redraw on the next publish.
- Proposed (not built): validate does not parse `teacher.yml`, so a colon in an unquoted summary only fails at build time (it has happened twice). A YAML parse of each `teacher.yml` in validate would catch it.

- Science map switched on (handoff above done): all 65 science lessons have `node:` (from their teacher notes; every one matched the kit's node labels), `map: true` in `content/science/index.md`, and `science` is in `CHECKED` (`tools/progressions.mjs`). 21 progression pages written with `tools/kit-page.mjs` from the kit. 18 lessons list `assumes:` for earlier nodes taught in class (each comment names the node); seasons and word equations list a node they deliberately come before. `tools/curriculum-map.mjs` and `site/curriculum-map.js` (Matthew approved): `WOVEN` strands (science's Human endeavour and Inquiry) show no waypoint dots, "woven through lessons and class work" in the row and card instead of "no lesson yet". Maths is unchanged.

- `playground-board/widgets/atom.js` (Matthew approved): `mode: halflife`, a `colour:` option for the table, and a stable or radioactive line in build mode (values `u`, `i`); a fix to "1 electrons". `playground-board/style.css` gains `.atkey`, `.atsw`, `.atstab`. Only atom lessons change; every board clip and picture redraws on the next publish, as with any board change.

- `playground-board/widgets/atom.js` gains `mode: decay` and `mode: shield` (alpha, beta, gamma; for 9U06 n3). Science-owned widget, no other file changed. As with any board change, every board clip re-records and every board picture redraws on the next publish.

- Board: two new widgets, `playground-board/widgets/atom.js` and `equation.js`, each a `<script>` line in `playground-board/index.html` and a small block at the end of `playground-board/style.css` (`.atgrid`/`.atcell` for the element table, `.eqtally` for the tally). Nothing existing changed. AUTHORING › 12 and CLAUDE.md › Science list them. `data/progressions/science/` holds four pasted pages (science is not in `CHECKED`, so validate is unchanged).

- Pictures on the science board (Matthew approved): `pictureBoard(lesson)` in `lesson-core.mjs` ('science' when a step uses `playground: science`, else 'board'); `usesBoardPictures` is now maths or science. `render-pictures.mjs` has a new `science` section (`drawScience`: the science board's `#board` after 1.8 s, cropped like the board's; `dist/_pictures/science/`); the board section's filter takes `pictureBoard(l) === 'board'`, so its hash and the maths pictures are unchanged. `build-site.mjs` reads the right folder.

- Board pictures for science (Matthew approved): `usesBoardPictures(lesson)` in `tools/lesson-core.mjs` (maths, or science with no step on the science board). Validate, `render-pictures.mjs` (the `board` job) and `build-site.mjs` (the picture lookup) use it instead of `language === 'maths'`. Maths pictures and their hashes are unchanged; science-board lessons (`playground: science`) still cannot have pictures (that needs a draw function for `_playground-science/`).

- `playground-board/widgets/universe.js`: the redshift spectrum is drawn 5 times bigger, not 20 (at 20, far galaxies showed no lines). AUTHORING › 12 `universe` line updated to match. Only the Redshift lesson uses it.

## Changed by the code chat: playgrounds and their courses (11–12 Oct 2026)

One block per playground. Course status is in `code.md`.

### Python playground (11 Oct, Matthew approved)

- **Pyodide on our own site.** `vendor/pyodide/` (Pyodide 314.0.7: core, pandas, FastAPI, Jinja2 and their dependencies, plus the Flask wheels from PyPI; 30 files, 24 MB) is committed, made by `tools/pyodide-vendor.mjs` (run by hand to change the version or packages). `buildPyPlayground` in `tools/build-playground.mjs` copies it to `dist/_pyodide/` (not stamped; its files are named by version) and builds `playground-py/` into `dist/_playground-py/`. No workflow change.
- `stampPlayground` also hashes `.py` files (only `playground-py/` has any; other playgrounds' stamps are unchanged).
- `tools/lesson-core.mjs`: `PLAYGROUND_KINDS` gains `python`; `unlockKind` maps `python` to `turtle`, and code checks on a `python` step use the turtle rules, so Python snippets, unlocks and code rules are shared. `tools/lesson-view.mjs` `PLAYGROUNDS` gains `python` (`_playground-py`). `tools/build-site.mjs` builds it, adds it to `VERSIONS`, and writes the turtle `unlocks.json` into it too.
- `tools/serve.mjs` serves `.wasm`, `.zip`, `.whl` and `.py` with proper types (Pyodide needs `application/wasm`). `render.mjs` is untouched, so no clip re-records.
- For Save the game (11 Oct): `snippets/turtle.json` gains a Files group (this re-records clips on the turtle playground, as any turtle snippet change does); `tools/concepts.mjs` gains Python concepts `file` and `json`; `misconceptions.json` gains `open-w-reads`; `tools/build-site.mjs`: the Deeper Python Reference shows the Files group and its Playground opens `_playground-py`.
- For Data detective (11 Oct): `try.files` on Python playground steps (data files from the lesson folder: validated in `tools/lesson-core.mjs`, copied to `<lesson>/files/` by `tools/build-site.mjs`, passed as `?files=&from=` by `tryEmbed` in `tools/lesson-view.mjs`; documented in AUTHORING). The playground adds missing lesson files, restores them on request and can add a file from the computer. **Fix in `evalRules`** (`tools/lesson-core.mjs`): Python comments are now stripped only outside quotes, so `"#" * 5` and `"#ff0000"` no longer cut a line short for `contains` rules (no existing lesson's result changed: validate passes). `snippets/turtle.json` gains a Data group (turtle-playground clips re-record again). `tools/concepts.mjs`: `csv`, `assert`, `pandas`. `misconceptions.json`: three entries. `tools/build-site.mjs`: Playground and Reference for `code/data`. `content/code/index.md`: Data detective is built; the machine learning card comes after `code/data`.
- For Web apps with Flask (11 Oct): `snippets/turtle.json` gains a Web apps group (turtle-playground clips re-record again); `tools/concepts.mjs` gains `decorator`; `misconceptions.json` six entries; `tools/build-site.mjs` Playground and Reference for `code/flask`; `content/code/index.md` lists `code/flask` on the Python and Web pathways (replacing the two planned cards).
- For Apps with Gradio (11 Oct): the playground's Gradio stand-in gains `gr.Radio`; tracebacks hide all of the playground's helper files; clips can pass a data file's text as `?file:<name>=` (the fix for the Data detective clips that failed in CI; AUTHORING updated). `snippets/turtle.json`: a quiz-question snippet in the Data group. `misconceptions.json`: three entries. `tools/build-site.mjs`: Playground and Reference for `code/gradio`.
- For Data detective's API lesson (11 Oct): the Python playground gains a `requests` stand-in (`playground-py/requests.py`, `wpFetch` in `worker.js`), and the package scan skips our stand-ins' imports (`requests`, `gradio`, `uvicorn`).
- For Machine learning (11 Oct): `vendor/pyodide/` adds scikit-learn (and scipy, joblib, threadpoolctl; `PACKAGES` in `tools/pyodide-vendor.mjs`), 43 MB in all; Check your school loads it too. `snippets/turtle.json`: a Machine learning group. `misconceptions.json`: three entries. `tools/build-site.mjs`: Playground and Reference for `code/ml`. `content/code/index.md`: the course is built.

### microStudio game player (11 Oct, Matthew approved link-out games)
- New playground kind `microstudio` (`PLAYGROUND_KINDS`, `unlockKind` maps it to `turtle` like `python`; `PLAYGROUNDS.microstudio` in `lesson-view.mjs`, titled "Play it", no saving). It is play only: `try: { playground: microstudio, starter: file#region }` shows the game running; no code checks.
- `playground-microstudio/index.html` plus `vendor/microstudio/` (microStudio's `microengine.js` and `runner.js`, Brython 3.11.3 and its stdlib, BitCell font; MIT and BSD-3 licences beside them). Built by `buildMicrostudioPlayground` in `build-playground.mjs` into `dist/_playground-microstudio/` (stamped; in `VERSIONS`). The page starts the engine itself when the game has no pictures (the engine otherwise waits for its first sprite to load) and replaces `Player.reportError` and `log` to show errors and prints over the game.

### p5.js playground (11 Oct)
- New playground kind `p5` (`PLAYGROUND_KINDS`; `unlockKind` returns `p5` when a lesson's `language` is `javascript`; `PLAYGROUNDS.p5` in `lesson-view.mjs`). `playground-p5/` plus `vendor/p5/` (p5 2.3.4, LGPL-2.1, unmodified, licence and README beside it), built by `buildP5Playground` in `build-playground.mjs` into `dist/_playground-p5/` (stamped, in `VERSIONS`). The sketch runs in a sandboxed iframe (`allow-scripts`); the page reports `{wp:'run', kind:'p5', ...}` like the other playgrounds.
- `tools/lesson-core.mjs`: `P5_RULES` (`contains`, `defs`, `params`, `calls`, `loops`, `returns`, `uses`) and a `p5` branch in `evalRules` that reads JavaScript (comments and strings skipped; p5's own hook functions are not "functions of your own"). No existing lesson's result changed.
- `tools/concepts.mjs`: `CONCEPTS.javascript` (23 concepts); the fenced-code scan also reads `js` blocks. Note the scan ignores text before a lesson's first `##`. `misconceptions.json`: seven entries. `tools/build-playground.mjs`/`build-site.mjs` only add the new builder. `render.mjs` untouched: no clip re-records.
- `playground-p5/p5-errors.js` is pure (like `python-errors.mjs`) but has no test script yet.
- p5 round-off (11 Oct): `loadSnippetFiles` in `tools/lesson.mjs` also reads `snippets/p5.json`; `tools/build-site.mjs` adds `PLAY['code/p5']`, a `REFS` entry, and an empty `PICS.javascript` (so p5 cards never borrow turtle pictures by id); the playground page hides the unlock button for p5. `playground-p5/p5-errors.js` fixes (wrong-case hint, Unexpected identifier order); `npm run check-p5-errors`.
- Proposed and approved (Matthew, 11 Oct): two new shared-board widgets for 9U04 n2 to n5, `playground-board/widgets/wave.js` (`mode: sound | refract | spectrum`) and `charge.js` (`mode: static | pair | current`), each a `<script>` line in `playground-board/index.html` and a block at the end of `style.css`. Sound and charge draw on a canvas inside `#board`, so `B.jsx` in `core.js` gets one line that removes a leftover `canvas.wpcv` before it starts a JSXGraph board (nothing else in core changes). Board clips and pictures re-record and redraw on the next publish, as with any board change.

- `tools/render-pictures.mjs` (board section): `drawBoard` now also waits for `#board canvas.wpcv`, so the canvas boards (`wave` sound, `charge`) can have pictures. Boards drawn with JSXGraph are unchanged.
- p5 pictures and clips (11 Oct): `tools/render-pictures.mjs` gains sections `p5` and `p5shown` (own folders `_pictures/p5`, `_pictures/p5shown`; no existing section's hash changed, `SHARED` not bumped), a `WP_ONLY=<name prefix>` filter for testing one kind, and the `expected` section skips `language: javascript` lessons. `tools/lesson-core.mjs`: `picture:`/`explainPicture` and `expected:` are accepted in p5 lessons (`expected` needs `playground: p5`). `tools/build-site.mjs`: p5 lessons read their pictures from `p5shown`; `PICS.javascript` reads `_pictures/p5`. `playground-p5/main.js`: `?zoom=`. p5 clips use the lesson's `app:` (port 8130), so `render.mjs`/`stage.html` are untouched.

### DOM playground (11 Oct)
- New playground kind `dom` (`PLAYGROUND_KINDS`; `lesson-core` maps `dom` to `html` for `unlockKind`, code checks and `expected:`; `PLAYGROUNDS.dom` in `lesson-view.mjs`). `playground-dom/` is built by `buildDomPlayground` into `dist/_playground-dom/` (stamped, in `VERSIONS`) and copies `playground-p5/p5-errors.js`. The HTML playground is untouched, so no HTML clip re-records. `?zoom=` zooms the code and the preview's page (not the playground itself, because that puts Playwright clicks in the wrong place).
- `playground-p5/p5-errors.js`: the not-a-function hint now says "a name the browser or p5 has" (check-p5-errors passes). p5 clips re-record at the next publish.
- `tools/concepts.mjs` `CONCEPTS.html`: `text-content`, `style-prop`, `class-list`, `input-value`, `console-log`, `create-element`, `append-element`. `content/code/html/make-it-react` now lists `text-content, style-prop` in `recipes` (metadata only, `lesson.md`, so no clip re-records).
- `misconceptions.json`: `selector-typo`, `selector-prefix`, `script-order`, `call-not-pass`, `class-dot`, `value-is-text`, `list-is-live`, `state-in-handler`, `name-typo`.
- Note: `check-decks` reports `robot-drive` slide 4 at 709px. This was already the case and is not from this change.

### microStudio playground, Reference and clips (12 Oct)
- `playground-microstudio/edit.html` and `edit.js` add an editor beside the player (`index.html`), which runs in an iframe on the same origin. `build-playground` copies `tools/python-errors.mjs` into `_playground-microstudio/`. Two changes to `index.html`:
  - `brython({ indexedDB: false })`: when the top page has another origin (the clip stage), Brython's cache never opens and it waits forever.
  - A guard sets `navigator.language` to en-US when `Intl` cannot read the browser's locale. With no `LANG` set (this sandbox), Chromium reports `en-US@posix` and Brython stops at load.
  - No existing clip used this playground, so nothing re-records.
- `tools/build-site.mjs`:
  - `PLAY` entries can name `page:` (the file to open, default `index.html`); `PLAY['code/games']` is the new entry.
  - New `REFS` entry `code/games/reference`.
  - `MS_SNIPS` is read on its own (not through `loadSnippetFiles`), so its card ids never shadow turtle cards of the same name.
  - `PICS.microstudio`, and `refItem` picks pictures by `target: microstudio`.
  - A course whose steps use `playground: microstudio` takes its cheat-sheet cards and pictures from `snippets/microstudio.json`.
- `tools/render-pictures.mjs`: new section `microstudio` (`_pictures/microstudio/`, the 9 examples). No other section's hash changed.

## Changed by the Digital systems chat (12 Oct 2026)

- New subject folder `content/systems/` (menu "Digital systems"; roadmap in `roadmap/systems.md`). No build changes were needed: subjects are found from the content folders.
- Board: new widget `playground-board/widgets/bits.js`, registered in `playground-board/index.html`, styles at the end of `style.css`. `core.js` unchanged. Editing the board folder re-records every board clip on the next publish (the clip hash covers the playground).
- `misconceptions.json`: two entries. AUTHORING › board: `bits` entry.
- Later the same day: `tools/progressions.mjs` (`CHECKED` adds `systems`; `yearOf` reads any learning-area prefix, so AC9TDI8K03 is Year 8; maths and science codes read as before), `tools/kit-page.mjs` (letter T → the kit's `data/technologies/`, written to `data/progressions/systems/`), `tools/import-curriculum.mjs` (subject `systems`: K descriptors only, rows by topic), `tools/curriculum-map.mjs` (`STRANDS.systems`) and the map's short codes (`6K03` rather than `DI6K03`; maths and science unchanged). New board widgets `decode`, then `pixels` and `sampling` (and `decode` gained `type: on` and `table: on`, which add to it), then `logic`; `pixels` gained `mode: bw`, `rle:`, `show: codes` and `lossy:` (additions). `tools/concepts.mjs` `prerequisites()` now includes `systems`. Then `network` and `security`. Then `hardware` (spec sheet and jobs; `systems/hardware`, ports 8479–8481). Then `gates` and `cpu` (`systems/logic`, ports 8482–8485). Then theory concepts across subjects: `THEORY` and `theoryIds` in `tools/concepts-core.mjs`; `tools/concepts.mjs` lints them across languages and exports `theoryLinks`; `tools/progressions.mjs` ignores theory ids in `assumes:`; `tools/build-site.mjs` passes `conceptLinks` and lists other subjects' lessons on a subject's curriculum map when they carry its descriptors; `tools/lesson-view.mjs` shows "Builds on" / "Put to work in" under the hook (`.clinks`). Frontmatter-only edits to code lessons: HTML & CSS first-page, selectors, sections, club-page (`node:` 10K02), microbit-security/caesar (`assumes: [text-as-numbers]`), p5/p5-shapes (`assumes: [rgb-colour]`). 10K02 now has a Digital systems home (`systems/web`, no coding); the HTML & CSS course keeps its tags as practice, and Rules and selectors got `assumes: [web-layers]` (frontmatter only) so its page links to Three layers. New board widget `webdoc` (ports 8486–8487). Then `shell` (`systems/shell`, ports 8488–8492). Then `cyber` (`systems/cyber`, ports 8493–8499 and 8540; 8540 sits above Engineering's 8500–8539). Then `shapes` (Data representation › Shapes as numbers, port 8541), `encode` and `source` (`systems/ctf`, ports 8542–8544); `THEORY` gains `vector-graphics` and `encoding`. Then `netctf` (Networks › Network capture the flag, port 8545). Clip-server ports: Digital systems lessons use 8460–8499; two maths lessons and two of ours had both claimed 8320–8333, so pick a fresh range when adding lessons.

## Changed by the Engineering chat (12 Oct 2026)

- New subject folder `content/engineering/` (menu "Engineering"; roadmap in `roadmap/engineering.md`). No build changes.
- Board: new widget `playground-board/widgets/gears.js`, registered in `playground-board/index.html`, styles at the end of `style.css`. `core.js` unchanged. Like any board change, every board clip re-records on the next publish.
- `misconceptions.json`: three entries (`bigger-gear-faster`, `gear-ratio-upside-down`, `gear-one-effect`). AUTHORING › board: `gears` entry.
- Clip-server ports 8500–8539 for Engineering lessons.
- Later the same day: new board widget `circuit` (`playground-board/widgets/circuit.js`, registered in `index.html`, styles at the end of `style.css`); `core.js` unchanged. `misconceptions.json`: four entries for the circuits course.
- Later again: new board widget `arduino` (`playground-board/widgets/arduino.js`, registered in `index.html`, styles at the end of `style.css`); `core.js` unchanged. `misconceptions.json`: six entries for the Arduino course.
- Engineering again: new board widget `breadboard` (`playground-board/widgets/breadboard.js`, registered in `index.html`, styles in `style.css`); the `arduino` widget gained `test:` cases (an addition). `misconceptions.json`: three entries.
- Engineering: new board widget `motor` (`playground-board/widgets/motor.js`, registered in `index.html`, styles in `style.css`). `misconceptions.json`: four entries.
- Engineering capstones: `tools/lesson-core.mjs` reads a new frontmatter key `shape:` (only `design` for now) into `lesson.shape`; `tools/lesson-view.mjs` adds `STAGE_INFO_DESIGN` (Inquire, Develop, Create, Test, Evaluate on predict, investigate, make, modify, practise) and picks it when `lesson.shape === 'design'`. Nothing else changes; no clip re-records (lesson-view is not in the clip hash). AUTHORING › Design projects.
- Engineering: new board widget `fab` (`playground-board/widgets/fab.js`, registered in `index.html`, styles in `style.css`). `misconceptions.json`: six entries.

- 12 Oct: `teach.mjs` honours `shape: design`. Decks and worksheets for capstone projects use the step's own title (Inquire, Develop, Create, Test, Evaluate), never "Predict" or "Make:"; the Inquire step renders as its check (the brief sort), not a prediction. Sort checks now list their items on slides (groups and items on one line each) and worksheets (one answer field per item). `check-decks` passes.
- 12 Oct (engineering chat): new board widget `train` (`playground-board/widgets/geartrain.js`, registered in `playground-board/index.html`, styles `.gmid` and `.gback`). Any board-playground change re-records board clips on the next publish.
- 12 Oct (engineering chat): new board widget `lever` (`playground-board/widgets/lever.js`, `mode: lever | pulley`), registered in `playground-board/index.html`, styles `.lv*` and `.pl*`.
- 12 Oct (engineering chat): new board widget `motion` (`playground-board/widgets/motion.js`, `mode: crank | cam | linkage`), registered in `playground-board/index.html`, styles `.mv*`.
- 12 Oct (engineering chat): new board widget `pcb` (`playground-board/widgets/pcb.js`, `mode: layout | route | rules`), registered in `playground-board/index.html`, styles `.pcb*`.
- 12 Oct (engineering chat): new board widget `truss` (`playground-board/widgets/truss.js`, `mode: truss | beam`), registered in `playground-board/index.html`, styles `.tr*`.
- 12 Oct (engineering chat): `THEORY` gained eleven Science ids (forces, energy, current, turning effect); physics lessons in `content/science/physics-7` to `physics-10` got one-line `introduces:` tags (no other change); `prerequisites()` in `tools/concepts.mjs` reads `engineering`. Science lesson pages now show "Put to work in" links to Engineering.

## Proposed (13 Oct 2026, code chat; Matthew agreed the plan, not scheduled): boards for teachers and a thin shared core
Full plan in the Project doc `boards-catalogue-plan`. Nothing built; no date set.
- **Why:** teachers should be able to find a board, try a setup and reuse it in their own lessons and decks; and 88 shared-board widgets (19,574 lines) plus 21 science-board widgets repeat the same plumbing, which makes boards slow to add and hard to keep consistent.
- **Facts checked:** shared board `playground-board/` has 88 widget files (maths about 41, systems 17, science 15, engineering 10 + `train`, code `classifier` and `serial`; only `graph` and `key` serve two subjects); `core.js` is 139 lines (setup parser, `B.jsx`, `B.post`, `B.save`, status). 30 widgets define their own `el()`, 27 their own `slider()`, 18 their own `btn()`. Science board `playground-science/main.js` holds 21 more widgets. Both hosts read the setup from `?code=`. Only `arduino`, `cpu`, `shell` and `gates`/`logic` take student-written code; no board is driven by blocks or Python. `create/` has no board kind.
- **Order when taken up:** (1) `/boards/` catalogue (a card per widget from `data/boards/<widget>.yml` plus the widget file's header comment; Open, Copy embed, values for `when:` checks, "Used in" links; a Try area with an editable setup); (2) `npm run check-boards` (every example starts, every listed value is reported, no widget without a card); (3) a `board` kind in `create/`; (4) later, per-widget forms or blocks/Python only if teachers ask.
- **Shared core (gradual):** add to `core.js` only controls (`B.slider`, `B.button`, `B.row`), element makers, a standard declaration of named values (`scope.vars`) and of settings. Keep it thin: widgets keep their own drawing (SVG, JSXGraph or canvas). Widgets move onto it one at a time when next touched, after `check-boards` exists, because changing a widget's markup re-records clips and redraws pictures for the lessons that show it.
- **Open:** cards as YAML in `data/boards/` or header-only; one catalogue for all subjects with a filter; whether `playground-science` joins the shared core later.
- Parallel chats: this touches shared tools (`core.js`, `build-site.mjs`, `validate`); check `git log` and this file first when taken up.
