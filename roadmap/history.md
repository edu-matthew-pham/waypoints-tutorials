# Roadmap: History

`content/history/` (not created yet). Set up 30 Oct 2026 so a History chat can start. Node content: waypoints-kit `data/history/`, copied in `data/curriculum/history.json`.

## Rules (decided 30 Oct 2026, Matthew; `roadmap/shared.md` › Decided: humanities)

- Pace-agnostic (`roadmap/shared.md` › Decided: tutorials are pace-agnostic): same waypoints in the node file's order, untiered path = minimum width, `tier:` steps are optional width on the same waypoint, a check (with `smaller:`) before leaving each hinge, no pace labels.
- One course per standard, folder `history/<short-name>-7`, one lesson per waypoint. Copy the pattern of `content/economics/scarcity-7/needs-and-wants/` (ICT lesson shape, `language: maths`, `node:` on every lesson, made-up places and people, Make steps written in the student's own book with a `reflect` tick).
- First Nations wider items: a teacher note that starts from ACARA's own elaboration for that content (the curriculum's sanctioned starting point) and asks the teacher to build on it with local, community-approved material. No student text written by us. The elaboration text is imported: `elaborations` on each standard in `data/curriculum/<subject>.json`, shown on its pointer page. Quote the relevant one in the lesson's teacher notes (see `content/economics/scarcity-7/needs-and-wants/teacher.yml`).
- Inquiry skills: questions, locating and organising, and creating explanations belong to the shared course (`roadmap/humanities-inquiry.md`); this subject builds only its own skills (below). The full investigation is class work.
- Add `history` to `CHECKED` in `tools/progressions.mjs` with the first lesson (say so in `shared.md`).

## Year 7 knowledge standards (start here)

| AC9HH7K03 | Continuity over deep time | 3 | 1 |
| AC9HH7K04 | Environmental response over time | 3 | 1 |

## Year 7 skills this subject builds itself

- AC9HH7S03 Identify source origin and purpose (3 nodes)
- AC9HH7S04 Describe source usefulness (3 nodes)
- AC9HH7S05 Describe cause and continuity (3 nodes)
- AC9HH7S06 Identify past perspectives (3 nodes)
- AC9HH7S07 Explain historical interpretations (3 nodes)

## Proposed

Nothing yet. First step: pick the first standard, write the course plan here (a table like `roadmap/economics.md`), then build lesson 1 as a pilot.

## Starter prompt for the History chat

> Read CLAUDE.md, ROADMAP.md, `roadmap/shared.md` › Decided (30 Oct 2026) entries, and `roadmap/history.md`. Look at `content/economics/scarcity-7/needs-and-wants/` end to end as the model lesson. Then propose the first Year 7 History course in `roadmap/history.md`, commit and push, and wait for me before building.
