# Roadmap: Engineering

An elective STEM layer beside Code, Maths, Science and Digital systems: `content/engineering/`. Not core Digital Technologies (Code and Digital systems carry that): what a school with kits, a makerspace or a STEM elective adds. Lessons apply Maths, Science and Code rather than re-teach them, and name their curriculum hooks (D&T Engineering principles and systems first) without aiming for descriptor coverage. Plans and reasons: Project docs `engineering-plan.md` and `physical-computing-plan.md` (12 Oct 2026).

Principles: borrow first and build only where a lesson needs a check (benchmark SparkFun, Raspberry Pi Foundation, Teach Computing, TeachEngineering; adapt only openly licensed material once the site licence is decided; link the rest); one home per idea (gates and vector vs raster stay in Digital systems); two lesson shapes, the maths shape for concepts and a design-project shape (brief, criteria and constraints, build, test, evaluate); build there, check here for outside tools (Tinkercad, Onshape, Blender), as the classifier does for Teachable Machine.

## Done (12 Oct 2026): subject and the winch

- Subject `content/engineering/index.md` ("Engineering", trail by units). Pathways: Mechanisms (built: Mechanisms; planned: Levers and pulleys), Physical computing (planned: Circuits with the micro:bit, Arduino, Power and motors), CAD and fabrication (planned), Design your own board (planned). 3D and animation was planned here; parked 12 Oct (see Parked).
- Course `engineering/mechanisms`, unit Gears: 1. Gear up the winch (from Project doc `engineering-sample-lesson.md`). Primer `primers/gears.md`. Misconceptions `bigger-gear-faster`, `gear-ratio-upside-down`, `gear-one-effect`. No `node:` (Engineering is not in the node check; there are no D&T progression pages).
- Board widget `gears` (AUTHORING › board): gears from a kit, Turn once, Lift (stalls), hidden numbers for the Try, `brief: edit` lists the pairs that pass (the Make: a brief with exactly one passing pair).
- Lessons use `language: maths` (board, answer and number checks, worked examples, maths stage names), as Digital systems does.
- Every board check tested in a headless browser; the explain clip records (silent here).
- Clip-server ports: Engineering lessons use 8500–8539.

## Done (12 Oct 2026): Circuits with the micro:bit

- Course `engineering/circuits` (Physical computing pathway, foundations), units Lighting an LED and Reading inputs: 1. A complete loop, 2. Why the resistor (Ohm's law with the LED's 2 V), 3. A button is an input (pull-down, floating pin; Make is a Parsons of the reacting program), 4. Sensors that vary (analog read 0–1023; Make is a night-light threshold). Primers `outputs.md`, `inputs.md`. Misconceptions `one-wire-enough`, `resistor-before-led`, `floating-pin-reads-zero`, `reading-is-volts`.
- Decision: the Predict is settled on our own `circuit` board (so every step has a check), and each lesson has a `tier: typical` "Build it in Tinkercad" step (reflect check), rather than checking Tinkercad work directly. Tinkercad numbers will differ a little from the board's model; the lessons say so.
- Board widget `circuit` (`mode: led | button | sensor`; AUTHORING › board). All board checks tested in a headless browser; the four explain clips record (silent here).
- Ports 8501–8504.
- Not checked against Tinkercad itself (needs a person and an account): the reflect steps' instructions and the overcurrent warning.

## Done (12 Oct 2026): Arduino

- Course `engineering/arduino` (Physical computing, after Circuits), units A new board and Writing C++: 1. Same circuit, new board (pins by number; the dim pull-up glow), 2. Reading the C++ (setup once, loop for ever, delay timing; Make a lighthouse), 3. Values and decisions (int, analogRead, if; the missing `;` and `=` in an if; Make a band with &&), 4. Talking to the computer (Serial print/println, the `"words" + n` trap, map to a percentage), 5. Outputs that vary (PWM as on-off, ÷ 4, non-PWM pins, the 8-bit wrap; Make turns the mapping round). Misconceptions `code-any-pin`, `setup-repeats`, `cpp-assign-in-if`, `cpp-plus-joins-text`, `pwm-lower-voltage`, `analog-range-mismatch`.
- Decision: a lesson board runs the sketches (`arduino` widget: a C++ subset on a model Uno with simulated time) so every Try, Vary and Make step has a check. Tinkercad stays the `tier: typical` second tool (blocks to C++, its serial monitor and oscilloscope). The plan's blocks stage (lesson 5 in blocks) became Tinkercad's Blocks + Text view inside lesson 1.
- Every board check tested in a headless browser with the expected solution; five explain clips record (silent here). Ports 8505–8508 and 8510.

## Done (12 Oct 2026): Real hardware (Arduino unit 3)

- Lessons 6–8 of `engineering/arduino`, unit Real hardware: 6. From simulator to breadboard (new `breadboard` widget: strips, the gap, rails; a real-breadboard upload step), 7. A small system (a plant-water alarm brief; the `arduino` widget's new **Run the tests** with `test:` cases; boundary testing, a steady state, a three-band fridge alarm), 8. The same project on a Pico (optional; no board: match C++ to MicroPython, convert 0–1023 to 0–65535 and ms to seconds, a Parsons, Wokwi or Thonny as a `tier: typical` step). Misconceptions `breadboard-rows`, `tests-skip-boundary`, `pico-same-numbers`.
- Hardware and upload steps are `tier: typical` reflect checks (Uno serial isn't read: `B.serial` filters for the micro:bit's USB id).
- All board checks tested headless; two new clips record. Ports 8511–8512.

## Done (12 Oct 2026): Power and motors

- Course `engineering/power` (Physical computing, extensions, after Arduino; Years 9–10), units Driving a motor and Batteries: 1. Why a motor can't run from a pin (transistor, flyback diode), 2. Motor drivers (H-bridge truth table, ENA as PWM, brake vs coast), 3. Two supplies, one ground (shared 0 V; a motor on the Uno's 5V resets it), 4. Choosing a battery (run time = capacity ÷ current, 80% margin, voltage and weight criteria; the Make leads to a LiPo), 5. LiPo safety (teacher-led, no board: sort, voltages, routine Parsons, a teacher sign-off reflect). Primers `drive.md`, `battery.md`. Misconceptions `code-runs-motor`, `one-signal-speed-direction`, `separate-supplies-no-ground`, `mah-is-strength`.
- New `motor` widget (`mode: pin | hbridge | ground | battery`). Battery figures are typical, not exact (teacher notes say so). Every board check tested headless; four clips record. Ports 8513–8516.
- Physical computing is now complete as planned (circuits, Arduino blocks to C++, real hardware, power). Still open: the plan's two-motor drive-base Make as a teacher project; Uno USB ids in `B.serial`.

## Done (12 Oct 2026): Capstone projects

- Course `engineering/projects` (Physical computing, extensions, after Arduino), all lessons optional, three units: Years 8–9 (Smart plant monitor, Parking assistant, Reaction game), Years 9–10 (Two-motor drive base, Automated sorter, Lift), Stretch (Off the breadboard, Design a PCB). Students pick one per band.
- Each is a design-cycle lesson (`shape: design`, new: Inquire, Develop, Create, Test, Evaluate on the existing stages): a brief sorted into criteria and constraints, a Develop step that prototypes the logic on a board where it can (arduino `test:` cases, the motor battery chooser, the gears board) plus a planned test table, reflect evidence for Create and Test, and an evidence question plus a written evaluation. Teacher notes map the steps to MYP Design A–D.
- The drive base, sorter and lift link Power and motors, Mechanisms, the classifier (Code) and CAD; the stretch unit stands in for the Design your own board pathway until it has its own course.
- Shared change: `lesson-core.mjs` reads `shape:`; `lesson-view.mjs` has `STAGE_INFO_DESIGN` (logged in roadmap/shared.md). Deck slides still title the Inquire step "Predict" (teach.mjs unchanged).

## Done (12 Oct 2026): CAD and fabrication

- Course `engineering/cad` (Design and print, foundations): 1. Design to a dimension (two walls; part + gap + wall; a Tinkercad case), 2. Parts that fit (printers shrink holes and grow pegs; sliding and press fits; a tolerance test card), 3. Design for the printer (supports over 45°, weak across layers; the slicer's layer preview), 4. Slicer trade-offs (layers double the time; walls beat infill). Course `engineering/parametric` (extensions, after cad): 1. Parametric design (driving vs driven dimensions; Onshape variables), 2. Laser cutting and kerf (optional; slot = drawn + kerf; a test comb). Primers `size.md`, `print.md`. Misconceptions `wall-one-side`, `same-size-fits`, `print-strength-equal`, `more-infill-better`, `edit-means-redraw`, `cut-on-the-line`.
- New `fab` widget (six modes; stated models, calibrate fits to the school's printer and cutter). Every board check tested headless; six clips record. Ports 8522–8527.

## Done (12 Oct 2026): Gear trains and Mechanisms practice

- `engineering/mechanisms/trains` (lesson 2, unit gears): an idler changes direction, not ratio (Predict, then the board with a choosable idler); a compound train multiplies its stage ratios (worked example 8 → 24 = 8 → 40 is strong enough but too slow; faded 16 → 40 = 8 → 24 passes; Kai adds the ratios); Vary chooses four gears for 1500 g in 40 s and the fastest train for 2500 g; Practise with a clock; Make a brief only a compound train can meet. New `train` widget (`geartrain.js`), misconceptions `compound-ratios-add` and `idler-changes-ratio`, primer updated.
- Practice page for Mechanisms (`practice/winch.yml`, `practice/trains.yml`): ratio, speed, strength, lift time, swapped gears; compound ratio, idler, compound speed, least ratio for a load.

## Done (12 Oct 2026): Levers and pulleys

- Mechanisms unit 2 (`levers`): `engineering/mechanisms/levers` (slide a pivot until 200 N lifts a 600 N rock; turning effects from the pivot; hand travel; class 2 wheelbarrow and class 3 forearm; sort the classes; Make a lever with two competing criteria, advantage 4.5 to 5) and `pulleys` (one fixed pulley changes direction only; add ropes; pull = load ÷ supporting ropes, rope = height × ropes, work in = work out; Mia counts the pulled rope; Make a brief that needs exactly 4 ropes; a match tying gears, levers and pulleys together). New `lever` widget (`mode: lever | pulley`), misconceptions `lever-distance-from-end` and `pulley-count-pull-rope`, primer `levers.md`, practice files for both. The Engineering index's planned "Levers and pulleys" course became "Linkages and cams" (planned).

## Done (12 Oct 2026): Linkages and cams

- Course `engineering/linkages` (Mechanisms pathway, extensions, after Mechanisms; unit motion): Cranks and sliders (stroke = 2 × radius whatever the rod; pump flow; Noah uses the radius; size a crank for a garden pump), Cams and followers (eccentric lift = 2 × offset; pear, snail, heart; displacement graphs; choose a cam for toys; a heart cam for a fish), Four-bar linkages (a longer crank jams; Grashof's rule, shortest + longest ≤ the other two; Ava adds the wrong pair; a wiper swinging ≥ 100°; a swing in a range). New `motion` widget (`mode: crank | cam | linkage`), misconceptions `stroke-equals-radius` and `grashof-wrong-pair`, primer, practice page.

## Done (12 Oct 2026): Your own board

- Course `engineering/pcb` (Design your own board pathway, extensions; unit From breadboard to board): Place the parts (nets, ratsnest, a placement order, a 100 mm and a 70 mm small-board brief), Route the traces (shorts refused, one layer with a detour, two layers with GND underneath; 119 mm against 94 mm of copper), Design rules and ordering (width for current, a trace too wide to squeeze between pins, setup plus per-board cost). New `pcb` widget (`mode: layout | route | rules`), primer, practice page. The Capstone projects' Off the breadboard and Design a PCB follow it with real tools.

## Done (12 Oct 2026): Structures

- Pathway Structures (Engineering index) with course `engineering/structures`, units Frames and trusses and Beams: Pull or push (a roof truss; tension and compression; bottom pull = load × span ÷ (4 × height); a height that meets 600 N and $125), Triangles hold their shape (a square collapses; one diagonal; members = 2 × joints − 3; Zoe adds 3; towers of two and three storeys), Design a bridge (a pinned deck folds; a big triangle buckles; buckling = 8000 ÷ L²; any bridge that holds, then $300 or less failing at 1400 N or more: a Pratt or Howe truss, $293, 1414 N), Beams and shapes (support shares; depth cubed; flat, edge, I-beam, tube; a shelf only the I-beam meets). New `truss` widget (`mode: truss | beam`, stiffness-method solver), misconception `truss-count-add`, primers, practice page. Note for teachers: the counting rule is necessary, not sufficient (two diagonals in one panel and none in another still collapses; the board shows it).

## Done (12 Oct 2026): links to Science

- Eleven theory concepts for Science ideas (`THEORY` in `tools/concepts-core.mjs`): physics lessons `introduces:` them (Year 7 arrows, balanced, weight; Year 8 kinds and transform; Year 9 conservation, efficiency, electric current; Year 10 third law, free body), Engineering lessons `assumes:` them (winch, levers, pulleys, crank, all four Structures lessons, circuits loop and resistor, power pin limit, H-bridge and batteries, PCB rules, the lift project). `turning-effect` is introduced by Engineering › Levers and assumed by Beams. Both pages show "Builds on" and "Put to work in". The concept lint now reads Engineering's pathways for course order (`prerequisites()`), and Structures is `after: [mechanisms]`.
- Not done: a `node:` tag for Levers on the science map was not added (Engineering lessons don't carry nodes).

## Done (12 Oct 2026): Real machines lose energy

- `engineering/mechanisms/losses` (Mechanisms unit Real machines; `assumes: [efficiency, energy-conservation, energy-transfer]`, so Science › Year 9 Efficiency and Conservation link to it): the winch's compound train lifts 2700 g, not 3000 g, at 95% per mesh; pulleys at 90% per wheel need 5 ropes instead of 3, and 9 and 10 ropes give the same pull; efficiencies multiply; work in = work out ÷ efficiency, the rest is heat and sound; a 900 N brief needs 6 ropes, not 3; the Gear trains brief redone (ratio 8.33 or 9 within 45 s). `efficiency:` option on the `train` and `lever` (pulley) widgets (default 100, so every earlier lesson is unchanged); pulleys now allow up to 10 ropes. Port 8600: Engineering's 8500–8539 are used up, so it continues at 8600–8639.

## Next

1. Practise with code: the sample lesson's Python loop over every gear pair. A maths lesson has no Python playground; either a short linked Python task (console bridge) or leave it to the Code pathway.
2. Mechanisms: efficiency per mesh on the `train` board and friction on pulleys (Years 9–10; now stretch tasks); Structures (loads, trusses) as a later pathway.
3. Optional: let `B.serial` accept an Uno's USB ids; surface-mount parts and 45° routing on the `pcb` board if a class wants them. (Done 12 Oct: compound gear trains; `shape: design` decks and worksheets say Inquire, not Predict.)
4. (Done 12 Oct: `prerequisites()` reads `engineering` too.)

## Parked

- 3D and animation (12 Oct): taken out of Engineering, which is about physical things designed to a brief. Parked for a later Digital Media / Design subject (with video, audio and UX if they come). Keep the computational framing when it returns: keyframes as data, tweening and easing as maths, frames per second, meshes as lists of points, Blender driven by its Python API, Autodesk as a nod. Builds on Digital systems › Shapes as numbers and Code › p5.js.

## Open questions

- Subject name: Engineering, Make or STEM.
- Pathway order: Mechanisms first (no kits), CAD, or Physical computing.
- Kits, printers, slicer and laser cutter at the school; Onshape or Fusion; Raspberry Pis.
- LiPos at all, or AA and NiMH only.
- Site content licence (decides whether CC BY-SA kit guides can be adapted).
